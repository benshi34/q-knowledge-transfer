So the total amount of juice will be $1+1+1+\\dfrac{1}{3} = \\dfrac{10}{3}$. If we divide the total amount of juice by 4, we get $\\dfrac{5}{6}$, which should be the amount of juice in each glass.

        "solution": "\nWe start by trying to prove a function of $n$, and then we can apply the function and equate it to $936$ to find the value of $n$.\n\nIt is helpful to think of this problem in the format $(1+2+3+4+5+6) \\cdot (1+2+3+4+5+6) \\dots$. Note that if we represent the scenario in this manner, we can think of picking a $1$ for one factor and then a $5$ for another factor to form their product - this is similar thinking to when we have the factorized form of a polynomial. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate to the problem because we can reach the same product in many ways: for example for $n=2$, $4$ can be reached by picking $1$ and $4$ or $2$ and $2$. However, this form gives us insights that will be useful later in the problem.\n\nNote that there are only $3$ primes in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$: $2,3,$ and $5$. Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form $2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j$ (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values $h,i,j$. So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ can be formed by taking the product of $n$ dice values. \n\nWe start our work on representing $j$: the powers of $5$, because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of $5$ in the set. Because of this, having $j$ fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking $j$ factors from the polynomial $(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots$ and choosing each factor to be a $5$. Now that we've selected $j$ factors, there are $n-j$ factors remaining to choose our powers of $3$ and $2$. \n\nSuppose our prime factorization of this product contains $i$ powers of $3$. These powers of $3$ can either come from a $3$ factor or a $6$ factor, but since both $3$ and $6$ contain only one power of $3$, this means that a product with $i$ powers of $3$ corresponds directly to picking $i$ factors from the polynomial, each of which is either $3$ or $6$ (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of $3$. \n\nNow we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair $(i,j)$ that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of $3$'s and the number of $5$'s our product will have. Then how many different $h$ values for the powers of $2$ are possible?\n\nIn the $i+j$ factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of $2$ in the $j$ factors with $5$. However, we can have a factor of $2$ pairing with factors of $3$, if we choose a $6$. The maximal possible power of $2$ in these $i$ factors is thus $2^i$, which occurs when we pick every factor to be $6$. \n\nWe now have $n-i-j$ factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of $2$. For each of these factors, we can choose either a $1,2,$ or $4$. Therefore the maximal power of $2$ achieved in these factors is when we pick $4$ for all of them, which is equivalent to $2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}$.\n\nNow if we multiply this across the total $n$ factors (or $n$ dice) we have a total of $2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}$, which is the maximal power of $2$ attainable in the product for a pair $(i,j)$. Now note that every power of $2$ below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of $2$ from an existing factor by dividing by $2$. Therefore the powers of $2$, and thus the $h$ value ranges from $h=0$ to $h=2n-i-2j$, so there are a total of $2n+1-i-2j$ distinct values for $h$ for a given pair $(i,j)$. \n\nNow to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible $i$s and $j$s. Lets take note of our restrictions on $i,j$: the only restriction is that $i+j \\leq n$, since we're picking factors from $n$ dice.\n\n$$ \\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j$$\n\nWe start by calculating the first term. $2n+1$ is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that $i+j \\leq n$. Set $i$ to $0$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n$, then set $i$ to $1$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n-1$, etc. The total number of pairs is thus $n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. Therefore the left summation evaluates to $$\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$$\n\nNow we calculate $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j$. This simplifies to $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j$. Note that because $i+j = n$ is symmetric with respect to $i,j$, the sum of $i$ in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of $j$ in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating $3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i$.\n\nIn the pairs, $i=1$ appears for $j$ ranging between $0$ and $n-1$ so the sum here is $1 \\cdot (n)$. Similarly $i=2$ appears for $j$ ranging from $0$ to $n-2$, so the sum is $2 \\cdot (n-1)$. If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is $(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1$. We can rearrange this as $((n)+(n-1)+ \\dots + 1) + ((n-1)+(n-2)+ \\dots + 1)+ ((n-2)+(n-3)+ \\dots + 1) + \\dots + 1)$\n\n$$ = \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}+ \\dots + 1$$\n\nWe can write this in easier terms as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(k)(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2+k$\n$$=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k)$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2})$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{3n(n+1)}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+4)}{6}$$\n$$ = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$$\n\nWe multiply this by $3$ to obtain that $$\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$$\n\nThus our final answer for the number of distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ is:\n$$\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$$\n$$ = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (2n+1-n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (n+1)$$\n$$ = \\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}$$\n\nNow most of the work is done. We set this equal to $936$ and prime factorize. $936 = 12 \\cdot 78 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$, so $(n+1)^2(n+2) = 936 \\cdot 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$. Clearly $13$ cannot be anything squared and $2^4 \\cdot 3^2$ is a perfect square, so $n+2 = 13$ and $n = 11 = \\boxed{A}$\n\n\n\n~KingRavi\n"

The probability is then $4\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right) = \\frac{8}{81}.$\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2: exactly zero numbers rolled are greater than 2}$\n\nThen, all four dice are either 1 or 2, so the probability of this is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{81}.$\n\nNow, we look at the $\\textbf{overlap}$. In other words, we want to find the probability none of the rolls are greater than $4$ and less than two of the rolls are greater than $2$. We split into the same two cases again.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1: exactly one number rolled is greater than 2 (and none of the rolls are greater than 4)}$\n\nThere are still 4 choices for this die, and it must be 3 or 4, with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. The other must read 1 or 2, with probability $\\frac{1}{27},$ so this case yields $4\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right) = \\frac{4}{81}.$ \n\n$\\textbf{Case 2: exactly zero numbers rolled are greater than 2 (and none of the rolls are greater than 4)}$\n\nThe first statement implies the second statement, so this case yields $\\frac{1}{81}$ as from our previous Case 2.\n\nNow we've got everything! Our answer is $1 - (\\frac{16}{81} + (\\frac{8}{81} + \\frac{1}{81}) - (\\frac{4}{81} + \\frac{1}{81})) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{61}{81}}.$\n\n~sirswagger21\n"

Substituting, we get $$7(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}) = \\frac{(1 + 2^{2019} * 16a) - (1 + 2^{2019}b)}{2^{2019}} = 16a - b.$$ Therefore, our answer can be written as $$\\frac{16a - b}{7}.$$ Another thing to notice is that a and b are integers between 0 and 6. This is because $$7(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \\cdots + 2^{2022}) \\geqslant 7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a$$ which is $$7(2^{2023}) - 7 \\geqslant 1 + 2^{2023}a$$ $$(7-a) \\geqslant \\frac{8}{2^{2023}}$$ which only holds when a is less than 7 because the right is very small positive number, so the left must be positive, too. Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, $$7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0$$ which would mean $$S_{2023} < 0$$ which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0.  A similar explanation for b shows that b is an integer between 0 and 6 inclusive. \n\nGoing back to the solution, if our answer to the problem is n, then $$16a - b = 7n$$ and $$16a = 7n + b,$$ so we can try the five option choices and see which one, when multiplied by 7 and added to some whole number between 0 and 6 results in a multiple of 16. Trying all the option choices, we see that you need to add 7n to something more than 6 to equal a multiple of 16 other than for option A. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}.$\n\n-Rutvik Arora (youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkgAgmNAQV8WGTOazGYEGwg)\n"

For this to happen $x$ must have $6$ divisors, which means its prime factorization is in the form $pq^2$ or $p^5$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers. Listing out values less than $50$ which have these prime factorizations, we find $12,18,20,28,44,45,50$ for $pq^2$, and just $32$ for $p^5$. Here $12$ especially catches our eyes, as this means if one of $f_i(n)=12$, each of $f_{i+1}(n), f_{i+2}(n), ...$ will all be $12$. This is because $f_{i+1}(n)=f(f_i(n))$ (as given in the problem statement), so were $f_i(n)=12$, plugging this in we get $f_{i+1}(n)=f(12)=12$, and thus the pattern repeats. Hence, as long as for a $i$, such that $i\\leq 50$ and $f_{i}(n)=12$, $f_{50}(n)=12$ must be true, which also immediately makes all our previously listed numbers, where $f(x)=12$, possible values of $n$.\n\nWe also know that if $f(x)$ were to be any of these numbers, $x$ would satisfy $f_{50}(n)$ as well. Looking through each of the possibilities aside from $12$, we see that $f(x)$ could only possibly be equal to $20$ and $18$, and still have $x$ less than or equal to $50$. This would mean $x$ must have $10$, or $9$ divisors, and testing out, we see that $x$ will then be of the form $p^4q$, or $p^2q^2$. The only two values less than or equal to $50$ would be $48$ and $36$ respectively. From here there are no more possible values, so tallying our possibilities we count $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }10}$ values (Namely $12,18,20,28,32,36,44,45,48,50$).\n\n~Ericsz\n"

Likewise, as $k$ decreases, the maximum possible value of $f_1(n)$ decreases as well. Also, let $f_1(n) = 2d(n)$ where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of n.\n\nSince $n \\le 50$, $f_1(n) <= 20$. This maximum occurs when $d(n) = 10 \\implies n = 2^4 \\cdot 3 = 48$. Next, since $f_1(n) <=20$, $f_1(f_1(n)) \\le 12 \\implies f_2(n) \\le 12$. This maximum occurs when $d(f_1(n)) = 6 \\implies n = 2 \\cdot 3^2 = 18, n = 2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12$. Since $f_2(n) \\le 12$, $f_1(f_2(n)) \\le 12 \\implies f_3(n) \\le 12$, once again. This maximum again occurs when $d(f_2(n)) = 6 \\implies f_2(n) = 2^2 \\cdot 3 = 12$. Now, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $f_2(n) < 12$. Then, $f_3(n) < 12$ (since $f_2(n) = 12$ was the only number that would maximize $f_3(n))$ for $f_2(n) \\le 12$). As a result, since $f_1(n)$ is increasing, and because $12$ is where $f_1$ steps down from a maximum of $6 \\cdot 2 = 12$, we must have that $f_1(f_3(n)) < f_1(12) = 12 \\implies f_4(n) < 12$. We continue applying $f_1$ on both sides (which is possible since $f_1$ is increasing) until we reach $f_50$, giving us that $f_50(n) < 12$. However, $f_50(n) = 12$, which is a contradiction. Thus, $f_2(n) = 12$. \n\nNow, let us finally solve for the solutions. $f_2(n) = 12 \\implies f_1(f_1(n)) = 12 \\implies d(f_1(n)) = 6$. $d(f_1(n)) = 6 \\implies f_1(n) = p^2 \\cdot q$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. Since $f_1(n) \\le 20$, $f_1(n)$ can only be $12$, $18$, or $20$. If $f_1(n) = 12$, then $d(n) = 6 \\implies n = p^5, p^2 \\cdot q \\implies n \\in \\{ 12, 18, 20, 28, 32, 44, 45, 50 \\}$, resulting in 8 solutions. If $f_1(n) = 18$, then $d(n) = 9 \\implies n = p^8, p^2 \\cdot q^2 \\implies n = 36$, giving us one more solution. Finally, $f_1(n) = 20 \\implies d(n) = 10 \\implies n = p^9, p^4 \\cdot q \\implies n = 48$.

Now the problem states that all $p(x)$ must satisfy $p(p(x)) = 0$. Plugging our form in, we get $$ ((x-r)(x-s)-r)((x-r)(x-s)-s) = 0.$$ \nThe roots of this equation are $(x-r)(x-s) = r$ and $(x-r)(x-s) = s$. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, each root must have two roots for a total of four possible values of $x$ yet the problem states that this equation is satisfied by three values of $x$. Therefore one equation must give a double root. Without loss of generality, let the equation $(x-r)(x-s) = r$ be the equation that produces the double root. Expanding gives $x^2-(r+s)x+rs-r = 0$. We know that if there is a double root to this equation, the discriminant must be equal to zero, so $(r+s)^2-4(rs-r) = 0 \\implies r^2+2rs+s^2-4rs+4r = 0 \\implies r^2-2rs+s^2+4r = 0 $.\n\nFrom here two solutions can progress.\n\n~KingRavi\n\n===Solution 5.1 (Quadratic Formula)===\n\nWe can rewrite $r^2-2rs+s^2+4r = 0$ as $(r-s)^2+4r = 0$. Let's keep our eyes on the ball; we want to find the disrespectful quadratic that maximizes the sum of the roots, which is $r+s$. Let this be equal to a new variable, $m$, so that our problem is reduced to maximizing this variable. \nWe can rewrite our equation in terms of $m$ as $(2r-m)^2 + 4r = 0 \\implies m^2- 4rm + 4r^2+4r = 0 $. \n\nThis is a quadratic in $m$, so we can use the quadratic formula: $$m = \\frac{4r \\pm \\sqrt{16r^2-4(4r^2+4r)}}{2} = 2r \\pm \\sqrt{-4r} = 2\\left(r \\pm \\sqrt{-r}\\right).$$\nIt will be easier to think without the square root, so let $q = \\sqrt{-r}$. We can rewrite the equation as $m = 2(-q^2 \\pm q)$. We want to maximize $m$, so we take the plus value of the right-hand-side of the equation. Then,\n$$m=2(-q^2+q) \\implies m = -2q(q-1).$$\nTo maximize $m$, we find the vertex of the right-hand side of the equation. The vertex of $-2q(q-1)$ is the average of the roots of the equation which is $\\frac{0+1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This means that $r = -q^2 \\implies \\boldsymbol{r = -\\frac{1}{4}}$ and $m = -2q(q-1) \\implies m = \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $m-r = s \\implies \\boldsymbol{s = \\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n~KingRavi\n\n===Solution 5.2 (Derivation-Rotated Conics)===\n\nWe see that the equation $r^2-2rs+s^2+4r = 0$ is in the form of the general equation of a rotated conic $$Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F = 0.$$ Because $B^2 -4AC = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 0$, this rotated conic is a parabola. \n\nThe definition of a parabola is the locus of all points that are equidistant from a point (focus) and line (directrix). Let the focus and directrix of this particular parabola be $(a,b)$ and $y = mx+c$. Then we can try to find the general form of a rotated parabola in terms of $a, b, m, $and$c$. \n\nThe distance between two points $(x,y)$ and $(a,b)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}$. Therefore this is the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus. \n\nThe distance from a point $(x,y)$ to a line $y = mx+c \\implies mx-y+c = 0$ is $\\frac{|mx-y+c|}{\\sqrt{m^2+1}}$.\n\nWe can set these two equal to each other and we get $$\\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2} = \\frac{|mx-y+c|}{\\sqrt{m^2+1}}.$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get $$(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 = \\frac{(mx-y+c)^2}{m^2+1}.$$\nExpanding both sides of the equation gives $$x^2-2ax+a^2+y^2-2by+b^2 = \\frac{m^2x^2+y^2+c^2+2mxc-2yc-2mxy}{m^2+1}.$$\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $m^2+1$ and rearranging gives $$x^2+2mx+m^2y^2-2((m^2+1)a + mc)x-2((m^2+1)b - c)y +(m^2+1)(a^2+b^2)-c^2.$$\nNow we can compare to our rotated parabola, $r^2-2rs+s^2+4r = 0$. From this, $-2 = 2m$ or $m = -1$. From here we have a system of three equations:\n$$\\begin{align*}\n-2((m^2+1)a + mc) &= 4, \\\\\n-2((m^2+1)b - c) &= 0, \\\\\n(m^2+1)(a^2+b^2)-c^2 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}$$\nPlugging in $m=-1$ we get\n$$\\begin{align*}\n-2(2a-c) &= 4, \\\\\n-2(2b-c) &= 0, \\\\\n2(a^2+b^2) - c^2 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}$$\nSolving for the first equation, $c = 2+2a$.\n\nSubtracting the first two equations, $-4a+4b = 4 \\implies b = a+1$.\n\nPlugging into the third equation, $2a^2+2a^2+4a+2 = c^2 \\implies 4a^2+4a+2 = c^2$.\n\nSubstituting $c$ in, we get $4a^2+4a+2 = 4a^2+8a+4 \\implies 4a+2 = 0 \\implies a = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow $b = a+1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $c = 2+2a = 1$.\n\nThis means that the focus of the parabola is $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and the directrix is $y = -x+1$. The maximum value of $r+s$ would lie at the vertex of the parabola, which is the midpoint of the focus and the foot of the focus at the directrix. The line that the vertex and focus lie on is perpendicular to the directrix, so it has slope $1$. It can be written as $y = x+d$ and must go through $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ so $d = 1$. This perpendicular line intersects the directrix, so to find the point at which this foot occurs, we set the equation of the lines equal to each other:\n$$\\begin{align*}\ny &= x+1, \\\\\ny &= -x+1.\n\\end{align*}$$\nAdding, we get $2y = 2$ or $y = 1$ and $x = 0$. The vertex of the parabola is now at the midpoint of $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and $(0, 1)$ which is $\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right)$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\boldsymbol{r=-\\frac{1}{4}}$ and $\\boldsymbol{s=\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n~KingRavi\n\n===Solutions 5.1 and 5.2 Rejoined===\n\nNow that we know the roots of $\\tilde{p}(1)$, we can plug in our equation: $$(x-r)(x-s) = \\left(1-\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = \\frac{5}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{5}{16} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{5}{16}}.$$\n~KingRavi\n"

Both of these equations are quadratics, so $p(p(x))$ has four roots, unless there's a double root. \n\nWithout loss of generality, let $(x-p)(x-q)-p$ be the expression that produces the double root, so its discriminant is zero. When expanded, \n$$(x-p)(x-q)-p=x^2-(p+q)x+pq-p=0.$$ \nThe value of $x$ is irrelevant to the discriminant, which is $(-(p+q))^2-4(pq-p).$ Setting this equal to zero and simplifing, this equation becomes $p^2-2pq+q^2+4p=0,$ which is a quadratic in $p$.\n\n\nNow, we seek the value of $p$. The previous quadratic is equivalent to $p^2-(2q-4)p+q^2=0$. Using the quadratic formula by having $a=1, b=-(2q-4)$, and $c=q^2,$ we have\n$$p = \\frac{2q-4\\pm\\sqrt{(-(2q-4))^2-4(1(q^2))}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2q-4\\pm4\\sqrt{1-q}}{2}=q-2+2\\sqrt{1-q}.$$\nOur focus is on maximizing $p+q$, so we need the maximum values of $p$ and $q$ respectively (by taking the positive square root). Adding $q,$ we see that\n$$p+q=2\\left(q-1+\\sqrt{1-q}\\right).$$\nLet $k=\\sqrt{1-q}.$ Then, $-k^2=q-1,$ so $p+q=2(-k^2+k).$ \n\n\nThe graph of $-k^2+k$ is a parabola that opens up downwards, and has its maximum value at $y$-value of the vertex. The $x$ coordinate of the vertex is the average of the two roots, which in this case, are $0$ and $1$, so the average of these two is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This means that the maximum value of $-k^2+k$ occurs at $k=\\frac{1}{2}.$ \n\n\nSubstituting $k=\\sqrt{1-q},$ we see that $q=\\frac{3}{4}.$ Since $p=q-2+2\\sqrt{1-q},$ we can plug $q=\\frac{3}{4}$ in, to see that $p=-\\frac{1}{4}.$\n\n\nBecause the roots of this quadratic are $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $-\\frac{1}{4},$ our quadratic is $\\left(x-\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(x+\\frac{1}{4}\\right).$ $\\tilde{p}(1)=\\frac{5}{16}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{5}{16}}$.\n\n~Benedict T (countmath1)\n"

Since there are $3$ real roots, then either one of them is complex, or two of them are the same. It is known that if complex number $w$ is a root to a certain polynomial, then so is $\\overline{w}$. So, if one root to $\\tilde{p}(\\tilde{p}(x))$ is complex, then another root should also be complex \u2014 we can't have that. So, two roots are equal; WLOG, assume it is $r_3=r_4$.

That can't happen either. So, $x^2+bx+c=x_1$ must have roots $r_1, r_2$ and $x^2+bx+c=x_2$ must have a double root $r_3$.

Also, from $2r_3=-b$, we have $r_3=-\\frac{b}{2}$. By Vieta's again, we have\n$$\\begin{align*}\nr_1\\cdot r_2 &= c-x_1 = r_1\\cdot r_2 = (r_3-k)(r_3-k) = r_3^2-k^2, \\\\\nr_3^2&=c-x_2.\n\\end{align*}$$\nSubtracting yields $x_1-x_2=k^2$.

Now, $c-x_2 = r_3^2$ by Vieta's. Plugging in $c, x_2, r_3=-\\frac{b}{2}$ gives\n$$\\frac{b^2-k^4}{4} + \\frac{k^2+b}{2} = \\frac{b^2-k^4+2k^2-2b}{4} = \\frac{b^2}{4}.$$\nSimplifying yields $2b=k^4-2k^2=(k^2-1)^2-1 \\ge -1$ by [[Trivial Inequality]].

        "solution": "Denote $B=(0, 0)$ and $C=(24, 0)$. Note that by Heron's formula the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{165\\sqrt{7}}{4}$ so the $y$-coordinate of $A$ (height of $A$ above the $x$-axis) is easily computed by the base-height formula as $\\frac{55\\sqrt7}{16}$.\n\nNow, since $AB=11$, the $x$-coordinate of $A$ satisfies $x^2+(\\frac{55\\sqrt7}{16})^2=11^2$ and solving gives $x=\\frac{99}{16}$.\n\nThe circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$ has radius $\\frac{abc}{4A}=\\frac{11\\cdot 24\\cdot 20}{165\\sqrt7}=\\frac{32}{\\sqrt7}$. We know by the perpendicular bisector rule that the circumcenter $O$ is located directly below the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ ($x$-coordinate $12$).\n\nSo, the negative $y$ coordinate of $O$ satisfies $12^2+y^2=(\\frac{32}{\\sqrt7})^2$ and solving gives $y=-\\frac{4}{\\sqrt7}$.\n\nIt's also clear that point $E$ is going to be located directly below $O$ on the circle, because the angle bisector intersects the circumcircle at the midpoint of the arc (Fact 5). Since the radius of the circle is $\\frac{32}{\\sqrt7}$, we have the coordinates of $E=(12, -\\frac{36}{\\sqrt7})$\n\nSolving for point $D$ (the point on the $x$-axis between $A$ and $E$), we get that $D=(\\frac{264}{31}, 0)$.\n\nSo now we know six of the critical points: $A=(\\frac{99}{16}, \\frac{55\\sqrt7}{16})$; $B=(0, 0)$; $C=(24, 0)$; $D=(\\frac{264}{31}, 0)$; $E=(12, -\\frac{36}{\\sqrt7})$; $O=(12, -\\frac{4}{\\sqrt7})$.\n\nWe are now ready to add in the circumcircle of $\\triangle BDE$, which has radius $\\frac{BD\\cdot DE\\cdot BE}{4[BDE]}$. From the above information, $BD=\\frac{264}{31}$, $DE=\\sqrt{(\\frac{108}{31})^2+(\\frac{36}{\\sqrt7})^2}$, and $BE=\\sqrt{12^2+(\\frac{36}{\\sqrt7})^2}$.\n\nAfter a bit of simplification we end up with $DE=\\frac{1152}{31\\sqrt7}$ and $BE=\\frac{48}{\\sqrt7}$.\n\nFor the area of $\\triangle BDE$, the altitude dropped from vertex $E$ has height $\\frac{36}{\\sqrt7}$, and the base $\\overline{BD}$ has length $\\frac{264}{31}$, so its area is $\\frac12\\cdot\\frac{36}{\\sqrt7}\\cdot\\frac{264}{31}=\\frac{4752}{31\\sqrt7}$.\n\nThus, $\\frac{BD\\cdot DE\\cdot BE}{4[BDE]}=\\frac{\\tfrac{264}{31}\\cdot\\tfrac{1152}{31\\sqrt7}\\cdot\\tfrac{48}{\\sqrt{7}}}{4\\cdot\\tfrac{4752}{31\\sqrt7}}$ which after tons of cancellations becomes $\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7}$.\n\nWe know from the perpendicular bisector rule that the circumcenter $P$ of $\\triangle BDE$ is located directly below the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$ ($x$-coordinate $\\frac{132}{31}$).\n\nSo, the negative $y$-coordinate of $P$ satisfies $(\\frac{132}{31})^2+y^2=(\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7})^2$, and solving gives $y=-\\frac{684}{31\\sqrt7}$. Thus, the equation of the circumcircle of $\\triangle BDE$ is $(x-\\frac{132}{31})^2+(y+\\frac{684}{31\\sqrt7})^2=(\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7})^2$.\n\nPoint $F$ is the intersection of this circle and the line $\\overline{AB}$, which has equation $y=\\frac{5\\sqrt7}{9}x$. So, we substitute $y=\\frac{5\\sqrt7}{9}x$ into the equation of the circle to get $(x-\\frac{132}{31})^2+(\\frac{5\\sqrt7}{9}x+\\frac{684}{31\\sqrt7})^2=(\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7})^2$.\n\nAfter simplifying, we have $\\frac{256}{81}x^2+16x=0$ (the $\\frac{768}{31\\sqrt7}$'s cancel out), whose solutions are $x=0$ and $x=-\\frac{81}{16}$. The first corresponds to the origin, and the second corresponds to point $F$. Thus the coordinates of $F$ are $(-\\frac{81}{16}, \\frac{5\\sqrt7}{9}\\cdot\\frac{-81}{16})=(-\\frac{81}{16}, -\\frac{45\\sqrt7}{16})$.\n\nThe coordinates of $C$ are $(24, 0)$, so $$CF=\\sqrt{(24+\\frac{81}{16})^2+(\\frac{45\\sqrt7}{16})^2}=\\sqrt{(\\frac{465}{16})^2+(\\frac{45\\sqrt7}{16})^2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{465^2+(45\\sqrt7)^2}}{16}=\\frac{\\sqrt{(15\\cdot 31)^2+(15\\cdot 3\\sqrt7)^2}}{16}=\\frac{15\\sqrt{31^2+(3\\sqrt7)^2}}{16}=\\frac{15\\sqrt{961+63}}{16}=\\frac{15\\sqrt{1024}}{16}=\\frac{15}{16}\\cdot 32=30.$$\n"

Since the degree of the dividend is $2021$ and the degree of the divisor is $2$, that means the degree of the quotient is $2021-2 = 2019$. Note that $R(x)$ can't influence the degree of the right hand side of this equation since its degree is either $1$ or $0$. Since the coefficients of the leading term in the dividend and the divisor are both $1$, that means the coefficient of the leading term of the quotient is also $1$. Thus, the leading term of the quotient is $z^{2019}$. Multiplying $z^{2019}$ by the divisor gives $z^{2021}+z^{2020}+z^{2019}$. We have our $z^{2021}$ term but we have these unnecessary terms like $z^{2020}$. We can get rid of these terms by adding $-z^{2018}$ to the quotient to cancel out these terms, but this then gives us $z^{2021}-z^{2018}$. Our first instinct will probably be to add $z^{2017}$, but we can't do this as although this will eliminate the $-z^{2018}$ term, it will produce a $z^{2019}$ term. Since no other term of the form $z^n$ where $n$ is an integer less than $2017$ will produce a $z^{2019}$ term when multiplied by the divisor, we can't add $z^{2017}$ to the quotient. Instead, we can add $z^{2016}$ to the coefficient to get rid of the $-z^{2018}$ term. Continuing this pattern, we get the quotient as $$z^{2019}-z^{2018}+z^{2016}-z^{2015}+\\cdots-z^2+1.$$\nThe last term when multiplied with the divisor gives $z^2+z+1$.

However, since $P$ is degree 5, there must be two additional roots. Let one of these roots be $w$, if $w$ is a root, then $we^{2\\pi i / 3}$ and $we^{4\\pi i / 3}$ must also be roots. However, $P$ is a fifth degree polynomial, and can therefore only have $5$ roots. This implies that $w$ is either $r$, $re^{2\\pi i / 3}$, or $re^{4\\pi i / 3}$. Thus we know that the polynomial $P$ can be written in the form $(x-r)^m(x-re^{2\\pi i / 3})^n(x-re^{4\\pi i / 3})^p$. Moreover, by Vieta's, we know that there is only one possible value for the magnitude of $r$ as $||r||^5 = 2020$, meaning that the amount of possible polynomials $P$ is equivalent to the possible sets $(m,n,p)$. In order for the coefficients of the polynomial to all be real, $n = p$ due to $re^{2\\pi i / 3}$ and $re^{4 \\pi i / 3}$ being conjugates and since $m+n+p = 5$, (as the polynomial is 5th degree) we have two possible solutions for $(m, n, p)$ which are $(1,2,2)$ and $(3,1,1)$ yielding two possible polynomials.

Next, we will prove that all 5 roots of the polynomial must be chosen from those 3 roots.

For example, $(2, 2, |, 2, 2, 2, |, 3)$ is equivalent to the arrangement $4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 3$.  Because there are $6$ ways to order the prime factors, and $2^5$ ways to place dividers, this gives us an initial $6 \\cdot  2^5$ ways to arrange divisors.  \n\nHowever, through this method, we overcount cases where $3$ is combined with another factor.  For example, the arrangement $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4$ can be written as $(2, 2, |, 2, 3, |, 2, 2)$ or $(2, 2, |, 3, 2, |, 2, 2)$.  Precisely, we double count any case with $6$ as a factor, triple count any case with $12$, quadruple count any case with $24$, etc.    \n\nNow, consider all cases where $3$ must be grouped with at least one $2$.  This can be expressed in the same \"line\" format as $(2, 2, 2, 2, 6)$, where dividers can again be placed to group divisors.  In this case, there are $5$ ways to order divisors, and $2^4$ ways to place dividers, so we have an $5 \\cdot 2^4$ possible sequences for this case.  Notice that in this format, we double count cases where $12$ is a factor, we triple count cases where $24$ is a factor, etc.  Precisely, for any case counted $n$ times in the first step, it is counted $n - 1$ times in this step.  Thus, if we subtract, we count each case exactly once.  \n\nSo, we get:\n\n$6 \\cdot  2^5 - 5 \\cdot 2^4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}$. ~[[User:hdai1122|hdai1122]]\n"

By a similar argument, $\\angle A_0A_1C_1=\\angle A_0C_0C_1=90^\\circ-x_0$. Thus, $x_1=\\angle A_0A_1B_1+\\angle A_0A_1C_1=180^\\circ-2x_0$. By a similar argument, $y_1=180^\\circ-2y_0$ and $z_1=180^\\circ-2z_0$.\n\nTherefore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $x_n=180^\\circ-2x_{n-1}$ (identical recurrence relations can be derived for $y_n$ and $z_n$). To find an explicit form for this recurrence, we guess that the constant term is related exponentially to $n$ (and the coefficient of $x_0$ is $(-2)^n$). Hence, we let $x_n=pq^n+r+(-2)^nx_0$. We will solve for $p$, $q$, and $r$ by iterating the recurrence to obtain $x_1=180^\\circ-2x_0$, $x_2=4x_0-180^\\circ$, and $x_3=540-8x_0$. Letting $n=1,2,3$ respectively, we have $$\\begin{align}\npq+r&=180 \\\\\npq^2+r&=-180 \\\\\npq^3+r&=540\n\\end{align}$$\n\nSubtracting $(1)$ from $(3)$, we have $pq(q^2-1)=360$, and subtracting $(1)$ from $(2)$ gives $pq(q-1)=-360$. Dividing these two equations gives $q+1=-1$, so $q=-2$. Substituting back, we get $p=-60$ and $r=60$.\n\nWe will now prove that for all positive integers $n$, $x_n=-60(-2)^n+60+(-2)^nx_0=(-2)^n(x_0-60)+60$ via induction. Clearly the base case of $n=1$ holds, so it is left to prove that $x_{n+1}=(-2)^{n+1}(x_0-60)+60$ assuming our inductive hypothesis holds for $n$. Using the recurrence relation, we have $$\\begin{align*}\nx_{n+1}&=180-2x_n \\\\\n&=180-2((-2)^n(x_0-60)+60) \\\\\n&=(-2)^{n+1}(x_0-60)+60\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nOur induction is complete, so for all positive integers $n$, $x_n=(-2)^n(x_0-60)+60$. Identical equalities hold for $y_n$ and $z_n$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest $n$ such that either $x_n$, $y_n$, or $z_n$ is greater than $90^\\circ$. WLOG, let $x_0=60^\\circ$, $y_0=59.999^\\circ$, and $z_0=60.001^\\circ$. Thus, $x_n=60^\\circ$ for all $n$, $y_n=-(-2)^n(0.001)+60$, and $z_n=(-2)^n(0.001)+60$. Solving for the smallest possible value of $n$ in each sequence, we find that $n=15$ gives $y_n>90^\\circ$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 15}$.\n"

($(3-0-0)$ cannot be achieved since either(1)the person cannot give money to himself or (2)there are a maximum of 2 dollars being distributed and the person has nothing to start with). We will consider these two states separately.\n\nIn the $(1-1-1)$ state, each person has two choices for whom to give their dollar to, meaning there are $2^3=8$ possible ways that the money can be rearranged. Note that there are only two ways that we can reach $(1-1-1)$ again: \n\n1. Raashan gives his money to Sylvia, who gives her money to Ted, who gives his money to Raashan.\n\n2.

Now, recall that the centroid of a triangle $\\triangle XYZ$ has position vector $\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\vec{x}+\\vec{y}+\\vec{z}\\right)$. \n\nThus the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$ is $g_1 = \\frac{1}{3}(m+1)\\vec{p} + \\frac{1}{3}n\\vec{q}$; the centroid of $\\triangle BCD$ is $g_2 = \\frac{1}{3}(m+1)\\vec{p} + \\frac{1}{3}(n+1)\\vec{q}$; and the centroid of $\\triangle ACD$ is $g_3 = \\frac{1}{3}m\\vec{p} + \\frac{1}{3}(n+1)\\vec{q}$. \n\nHence $\\overrightarrow{G_{1}G_{2}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\vec{q}$, $\\overrightarrow{G_{2}G_{3}} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\vec{p}$, and $\\overrightarrow{G_{3}G_{1}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\vec{p} - \\frac{1}{3}\\vec{q}$.

        "solution": "This solution has a similar idea to that of above.\nWe will start off with casework on $a_{7}$:\nIf $a_7 = -1$, we can show that there is no way to assign the values of $-1, 0, 1$ to the other $a_{i}$'s for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$. This is because even if we make all of the other $a_{i}$ equal to $1$, we will have that our number is $(-1)(3^{7}) + (3^{6}+3^{5}+...+3^{0}) = -3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1}$. However, note that since $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$, $-3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 0$.\nIf $a_{7}=0$, we can ignore $a_{7}$ and pretend like it never even existed. This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having $a_{0}...a_{7}$, we only have $a_{0}...a_{6}$. Now, we introduce some notation: let the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the form of $a_{n} \\cdot 3^{n} + ... + a_{0} \\cdot 3^{0}$ be denoted as $S_{n}$. Then, the problem is asking us for $S_{7}$, and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is $S_{6}$. Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later.\nIf $a_{7}=1$, we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the $a_{i}$, we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$. So, even if we let $a_{i}=-1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$, we will still have $3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0$. So, for this case, we have $3^7$ possible nonnegative integers.\nTotalling up our values from the three cases, we see that $S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}$. In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers $n$, $S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}$. We can now start building up our values for $S$: $S_{0} = 2$ ($a_{0} = 0, 1$), $S_{1} = 3^{1}+S_{0} = 5, S_{2} = 14, ..., S_{6}=1094$. So, we have $S_{7} = 2187 + 1094 = \\boxed{3281}$, which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.\n~advanture\n"

The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$ . (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.)

Even though it may not be as quick as some of the solutions above, I feel like it is an interesting concept, and may be more motivated. \n\nTo begin, we consider the sequence $B$ formed when we take the difference of consecutive terms between $A.$ Define $b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n.$ Notice that for $n \\ge 4,$ we have <center>$\\begin{cases}\\begin{aligned} a_{n+1} &= a_{n} - a_{n-1} + (n+1) \\\\ a_{n} &= a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} + n \\end{aligned}.\\end{cases}$</center> Notice that subtracting the second equation from the first, we see that $b_{n} = b_{n-1} - b_{n-2} + 1.$ \n\nIf you didn\u2019t notice that $B$ repeated directly in the solution above, you could also, possibly more naturally, take the finite differences of the sequence $b_n$ so that you could define $c_n = b_{n+1} - b_n.$ Using a similar method as above through reindexing and then subtracting, you could find that $c_n = c_{n-1} - c_{n-2}.$ The sum of any six consecutive terms of a sequence which satisfies such a recursion is $0,$ in which you have that $b_{n} = b_{n+6}.$ In the case in which finite differences didn\u2019t reduce to such a special recursion, you could still find the first few terms of $C$ to see if there are any patterns, now that you have a much simpler sequence. Doing so in this case, it can also be seen by seeing that the sequence $C$ looks like $$\\underbrace{2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, \\ldots$$ in which the same result follows. \n\nUsing the fact that $B$ repeats every six terms, this motivates us to look at the sequence $B$ more carefully. Doing so, we see that $B$ looks like $$\\underbrace{2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0,}_{\\text{cycle period}} 2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0, \\ldots$$ (If you tried pattern finding on sequence $B$ directly, you could also arrive at this result, although I figured defining a second sequence based on finite differences was more motivated.)\n\nNow, there are two ways to finish. \n\nFinish Method #1: Notice that any six consecutive terms of $B$ sum to $6,$ after which we see that $a_n = a_{n-6} + 6.$ Therefore, $a_{2018} = a_{2012} + 6 = \\cdots = a_{2} + 2016 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$\n\nFinish Method #2: Notice that $a_{2018} = a_{2017} - a_{2016} + 2018 = B_{2016} + 2018 = -1 + 2018 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$ \n\n~Professor-Mom\n"

This solution proceeds by a cleaner generating function.\n\nWe note that $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$ both lie on the imaginary axis and each of the $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(\\pm 1\\pm i)$ have length $\\frac{1}{2}$ and angle of odd multiples of $\\pi/4$, i.e. $\\pi/4,3\\pi/4,5\\pi/4,7\\pi/4$. When we draw these 6 complex numbers out on the complex plane, we get a crystal-looking thing. Note that the total number of ways to choose 12 complex numbers is $6^{12}$. Now we count the number of good combinations.\n\nWe first consider the lengths. When we multiply 12 complex numbers together, their magnitudes multiply. Suppose we have $n$ of the numbers $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$; then we must have $\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^n\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{12-n}=1 \\Longrightarrow n=8$. Having $n=8$ will take care of the length of the product; now we need to deal with the angle.\n\nWe require $\\sum\\theta\\equiv\\pi \\mod 2\\pi$. Letting $z$ be $e^{i\\pi/4}$, we see that the angles we have available are $\\{z^1,z^2,z^3,z^5,z^6,z^7\\}$, where we must choose exactly 8 angles from the set $\\{z^2,z^6\\}$ and exactly 4 from the set $\\{z^1,z^3,z^5,z^7\\}$. If we found a good combination where we had $a_i$ of each angle $z^i$, then the amount this would contribute to our count would be $\\binom{12}{4,8}\\cdot\\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\cdot\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}$. We want to add these all up. We proceed by generating functions.\n\nConsider $$(t_2x^2+t_6x^6)^8(t_1x^1+t_3x^3+t_5x^5+t_7x^7)^4.$$ The expansion will be of the form $\\sum_i\\left(\\sum_{\\sum a=i} \\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}{t_1}^{a_1}{t_2}^{a_2}{t_3}^{a_3}{t_5}^{a_5}{t_6}^{a_6}{t_7}^{a_7}x^i \\right)$. Note that if we reduced the powers of $x$ mod $8$ and fished out the coefficient of $x^4$ and plugged in $t_i=1\\ \\forall\\,i$ (and then multiplied by $\\binom{12}{4,8}$) then we would be done. Since plugging in $t_i=1$ doesn't affect the $x$'s, we do that right away. The expression then becomes $$x^{20}(1+x^4)^8(1+x^2+x^4+x^6)^4=x^{20}(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,$$ where the last equality is true because we are taking the powers of $x$ mod $8$. Let $[x^n]f(x)$ denote the coefficient of $x^n$ in $f(x)$. Note $[x^4] x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=[x^0](1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4$. We use the roots of unity filter, which states $$\\text{terms of }f(x)\\text{ that have exponent congruent to }k\\text{ mod }n=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{m=1}^n \\frac{f(z^mx)}{z^{mk}},$$ where $z=e^{i\\pi/n}$. In our case $k=0$, so we only need to find the average of the $f(z^mx)$'s.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz^0 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\\nz^1 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\\nz^2 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\\nz^3 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4,\\\\\nz^4 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\\nz^5 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\\nz^6 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\\nz^7 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4.\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nWe plug in $x=1$ and take the average to find the sum of all coefficients of $x^{\\text{multiple of 8}}$.

Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$, we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$. Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer.\n\nFrom this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$. We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$. Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$. \n\nThe average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$. The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$. We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$. There are four possibilities: $28$, $35$, $42$, $49$.\nHowever, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$.)\n\nThus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$. We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$. The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$. Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$, the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$. However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$. Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$.\nOur final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$.\n"

Using the given information that each test score was a distinct integer from $91$ to $100$ inclusive and that the seventh score was 95, we get $91+92+93+94+96\\leq T\\leq 100+99+98+97+96$.

If the $a_6$ is different from the $a_7$, then the last score must be a multiple of 7 away from $a_6$. However, $95-7=88$ and $95+7=102$ clearly cannot be $a_6$ since they are outside the range of 91 to 100. Thus, $a_6$ must be 95. Additionally, $a_5$ cannot be 95 since that would mean the sixth score is 95, which isn't possible since scores can't repeat (also, it's not an answer choice). Intuitively, $a_5$ should be close to 95 due to the constraint on the range of scores. We can try 94 and 96 for $a_5$. Again, the sixth score must be a multiple of 6 (preferably only one multiple) away from $a_5$. The only one that works is $94+6=100$, and we can check that the rest don't work since they exceed the range. The answer is $\\boxed{\\bold{(E)} 100}$.\n\n- Lingjun :)\n"

        "solution": "\nPlugging $2$ and $m$ into $P(x)$ and equating them, we get $8+4a+2b+c = m^3+am^2+bm+c$. Rearranging, we have $$(m^3-8) + (m^2 - 4)a + (m-2)b = 0.$$ Note that the value of $c$ won't matter as it can be anything in the provided range, giving a total of $41$ possible choices for $c.$ So what we just need to do is to just find the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ that work, and multiply it by $41.$\nWe can start by first dividing both sides by $m-2.$ (Note that this is valid since $m\\neq2:$ $$m^2 + 2m + 4 + (m+2)a + b = 0.$$ We can rearrange this so it is a quadratic in $m$: $$m^2 + (a+2)m + (4 + 2a + b) = 0.$$ Remember that $m$ has to be unique and not equal to $2.$ We can split this into two cases: case $1$ being that $m$ has exactly one solution, and it isn't equal to $2$; case $2$ being that $m$ has two solutions, one being equal to $2,$ but the other is a unique solution not equal to $2.$\n\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1:}$\n\nThere is exactly one solution for $m,$ and that solution is not $2.$ This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is $0,$ using that, we have $(a+2)^2 = 4(4 + 2a + b),$ rearranging in a neat way, we have $$(a-2)^2 = 4(4 + b)\\Longrightarrow a = 2\\pm2\\sqrt{4+b}.$$ Using the fact that $4+b$ must be a perfect square, we can easily see that the values for $b$ can be $-4, -3, 0, 5,$ and $12.$ Also since it's a \"$\\pm$\" there will usually be $2$ solutions for $a$ for each value of $b.$ The two exceptions for this would be if $b = -4$ and $b = 12.$ For $b=-4$ because it would be a $\\pm0,$ which only gives one solution, instead of two. And for $b=12$ because then $a = -6$ and the solution for $m$ would equal to $2,$ and we don't want this. (We can know this by putting the solutions back into the quadratic formula). \n\nSo we have $5$ solutions for $b,$ each of which give $2$ values for $a,$ except for $2,$ which only give one. So in total, there are $5*2 - 2 = 8$ ordered pairs of $(a,b)$ in this case.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2:}$\n\n$m$ has two solutions, but exactly one of them isn't equal to $2.$ This ensures that $1$ of the solutions is equal to $2.$\n\nLet $r$ be the other value of $m$ that isn't $2.$ By Vieta: \n$$\\begin{align*}\nr+2 &= -a-2\\\\\n2r &= 4+2a+b.\n\\end{align*}$$ From the first equation, we subtract both sides by $2$ and double both sides to get $2r = -2a - 8$ which also equals to $4+2a+b$ from the second equation. Equating both, we have $4a + b + 12 = 0.$ We can easily count that there would be $11$ ordered pairs $(a,b)$ that satisfy that.\n\nHowever, there's an outlier case in which $r$ happens to also equal to $2,$ and we don't want that. We can reverse engineer and find out that $r=2$ when $(a,b) = (-6, 12),$ which we overcounted. So we subtract by one and we conclude that there are $10$ ordered pairs of $(a,b)$ that satisfy this case.\n\n\nThis all shows that there are a total of $8+10 = 18$ amount of ordered pairs $(a,b).$ Multiplying this by $41$ (the amount of values for $c$) we get $18\\cdot41=\\boxed{738}$ as our final answer.\n\n~s214425\n"

        "solution": "\nWe can solve this problem using casework, with one case for each possible pair of consecutive numbers.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1: (1,2)}$\n\nIf we have (1,2) as our pair, we are left with the numbers from 3-10 as elements that can be added to our subset. So, we must compute how many ways we can pick these numbers so that the set has no consecutive numbers other than (1,2). Our first option is to pick no more numbers, giving us $8 \\choose {0}$. We can also pick one number, giving us $7 \\choose {1}$ because 3 cannot be picked. Another choice is to pick two numbers and in order to make sure they are not consecutive we must fix one number in between them, giving us $6 \\choose {2}$. This pattern continues for each amount of numbers, yielding $5 \\choose {3}$ for 3 numbers and $4 \\choose {4}$ for four numbers. Adding these up, we have $8 \\choose {0}$ + $7 \\choose {1}$ + $6 \\choose {2}$ + $5 \\choose {3}$ + $4 \\choose {4}$ = $\\textbf{34}$.\n\n\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2: (2,3)}$\n\nIf we have (2,3) as our pair, everything works the same as with (1,2), because 1 is still unusable as it is consecutive with 2.

Using the same pattern as before, we have $7 \\choose {0}$ + $6 \\choose {1}$ + $5 \\choose {2}$ + $4 \\choose {3}$ = $\\textbf{21}$.\n\n\n\n$\\textbf{Case 3: (3,4)}$\n\nThis case remains pretty much the same except we now have an option of whether or not to include 1. If we want to represent this like we have with our other choices, we would say $2 \\choose {0}$ for choosing no numbers and $1 \\choose {1}$ for choosing 1, leaving us with $2 \\choose {0}$ + $1 \\choose {1}$ = 2 choices (either including the number 1 in our subset or not including it). As far as the numbers from 5-10, our pattern from previous cases still holds. We have $6 \\choose {0}$ + $5 \\choose {1}$ + $4 \\choose {2}$ + $3 \\choose {3}$ = 13. With 2 choices on one side and 13 choices on the other side, we have $2\\cdot13$ = $\\textbf{26}$ combinations in all.\n\n\n\n$\\textbf{Case 4: (4,5)}$\n\nFollowing the patterns we have already created in our previous cases, for the numbers 1-3 we have $3 \\choose {0}$ + $2 \\choose {1}$ = 3 choices (1, 2, or neither) and for the numbers 6-10 we have $5 \\choose {0}$ + $4 \\choose {1}$ + $3 \\choose {2}$ = 8 choices. With 3 choices on one side and 8 choices on the other side, we have $3\\cdot8$ = $\\textbf{24}$ combinations in all.\n\n\n\n$\\textbf{Case 5: (5,6)}$\n\nAgain following the patterns we have already created in our previous cases, for the numbers 1-4 we have $4 \\choose {0}$ + $3 \\choose {1}$ + $2 \\choose {2}$ = 5 choices and for the numbers 5-10 we have the same $4 \\choose {0}$ + $3 \\choose {1}$ + $2 \\choose {2}$ = 5 choices. $5\\cdot5$ = $\\textbf{25}$ combinations in all.\n\n\n\n$\\textbf{Rest of the cases}$\n\nBy symmetry, the case with (6,7) will act the same as case 4 with (4,5).

Equating the 2 expressions, you get that $\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{BPQ})}{BQ}=\\frac{\\sin(\\angle{QPC})}{QP}$. Now drop the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. As it is commonly known that the dropped altitude forms a $5-12-13$ and a $9-12-15$ triangle, you get the measures of $\\angle{ABC}$ and $\\angle{ACB}$ respectively, which are $\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$ and $\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$. However, by the inscribed angle theorem, you get that $\\angle{BPQ}=\\arcsin(\\frac{4}{5})$ and that $\\angle{QPC}=\\arcsin(\\frac{12}{13})$, respectively. Therefore, by Law of Sines (as previously stated) $\\frac{BQ}{CQ}=\\frac{13}{15}$.\n\nNow commence coordbashing. Let $B$ be the origin, and $A$ be the point $(5,12)$. As $AP$ passes through $A$, which is $(5,12)$, and $M$, which is $(7,0)$, it has the equation $-6x+42$, so therefore a point on this line can be written as $(x,42-6x)$. As we have the ratio of the lengths, which prompts us to write the lengths in terms of the distance formula, we can just plug and chug it in to get the ratio $\\frac{\\sqrt{37x^2-504x+1764}}{\\sqrt{37x^2-532x+1960}}=\\frac{13}{15}$. This can be squared to get $\\frac{37x^2-504x+1764}{37x^2-532x+1960}=\\frac{169}{225}$.

Similarly, sequences with {30,40} and {40,50} will not give us any subtractions because those sequences must all include a 20. Let's stick with the lower ones for a minute: if we take them two at a time, then {3,5} will give us the subtraction of 1 sequence {3,5,7,9}. We have exhausted all pairs of numbers we can take, and if we take the triplet of single digit numbers, the only possible sequence must have a 6, which we already don't count.

Notice that $6 = \\binom{4}{2}$ - let's prove that $S_n = n \\cdot \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$ (note that you can assume this and answer the problem if you're running short on time in the real test).\n\nLet's analyze the element $k$ - to find a general solution, we must count the number of these subsets that $k$ appears in. For $k$ to be in both $A$ and $B$, we need both sets to contain $k$ and another subset of $1$ through $n$ not including $k$. ($A = \\{k\\} \\cup A'| A' \\subset \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\} \\land A' \\not \\subset \\{k\\} $ and \n$B = \\{k\\} \\cup B'| B' \\subset \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\} \\land B' \\not \\subset \\{k\\} $)\n\nFor any $0\\leq l \\leq n-1$ that is the size of both $A'$ and $B'$, the number of ways to choose the subsets $A'$ and $B'$ is $\\binom{n-1}{l}$ for both subsets, so the total number of ways to choose the subsets are $\\binom{n-1}{l}^2$.\nNow we sum this over all possible $l$'s to find the total number of ways to form sets $A$ and $B$ that contain $k$. This is equal to $\\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{l}^2$. This is a simplification of Vandermonde's identity, which states that $\\sum_{k=0}^{r} \\binom{m}{k} \\cdot \\binom{n}{r-k} = \\binom{m+n}{r}$. Here, $m$, $n$ and $r$ are all $n-1$, so this sum is equal to $\\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$. Finally, since we are iterating over all $k$'s for $n$ values of $k$, we have $S_n = n \\cdot \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$, proving our claim.\n\nWe now plug in $S_n$ to the expression we want to find. This turns out to be $\\frac{2022 \\cdot \\binom{4042}{2021}}{2021 \\cdot \\binom{4040}{2020}}$.

This means $x+50$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nNotice that if a number is divisible by 5, it must end with a 0 or 5. Since 5 is impossible (obviously, since multiples of 12 end in 2, 4, 6, 8, 0,...), $x$ must end in 0.\n\nNotice that the multiples of 12 that end in 0 are: 60, 120, 180, etc.. By trying out, you can clearly see that $x=300$ is the minimum number of people at the concert.\n\nSo therefore, after 50 more people arrive, there are $300+50=350$ people at the concert, and the number of adults is $350*\\frac{11}{25}=154$.

We first observe $a$ must be at most 10; if $a \\ge 11$, then $2^a - 2^b \\ge 2^{10} > 1000$. As $2^{10} = 1024 \\approx 1000$, we can first choose two different numbers $a > b$ from the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$ in $\\binom{11}{2}=55$ ways. This includes $(a,b) = (10,0)$, $(10,1)$, $(10,2)$, $(10,3)$, $(10,4)$ which are invalid as $2^a - 2^b > 1000$ in this case. For all other choices $a$ and $b$, the value of $2^a - 2^b$ is less than 1000.\n\nWe claim that for all other choices of $a$ and $b$, the values of $2^a - 2^b$ are pairwise distinct. More specifically, if $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ where $10 \\ge a_1 > b_1 \\ge 0$ and $10 \\ge a_2 > b_2 \\ge 0$, we must show that $2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} \\neq 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}$. Suppose otherwise for sake of contradiction; rearranging yields $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2^{a_2}+2^{b_1}$. We use the fact that every positive integer has a unique binary representation:\n\nIf $a_1 \\neq b_2$ then $\\{a_1,b_2\\} = \\{a_2,b_1\\}$; from here we can deduce either $a_1=a_2$ and $b_1=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption that $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$, or $a_1=b_1$ and $a_2=b_2$ (contradicting the assumption $a_1>b_1$ and $a_2>b_2$).\n\nIf $a_1 = b_2$ then $2^{a_1}+2^{b_2} = 2 \\times 2^{a_1}$, and it follows that $a_1=a_2=b_1=b_2$, also contradicting the assumption $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$. Hence we obtain contradiction.*\n\nThen there are $\\binom{11}{2}-5$ choices for $(a,b)$ for which $2^a - 2^b$ is a positive integer less than 1000; by the above claim, each choice of $(a,b)$ results in a different positive integer $n$. Then there are $55-5 = \\boxed{050}$ integers which can be expressed as a difference of two powers of 2.\n\n\n*Note: The uniqueness of binary representation could be rather easily proven, but if you cannot convince yourself on the spot that this is the case, consider the following alternative proof. Let $(a_1,b_1) \\neq (a_2,b_2)$ where $10 \\ge a_1 > b_1 \\ge 0$ and $10 \\ge a_2 > b_2 \\ge 0$ and $2^{a_1}-2^{b_1} = 2^{a_2} - 2^{b_2}$, for the sake of contradiction. Therefore $\\deg_{2}(2^{a_1}-2^{b_1})=\\deg_{2}(2^{a_2}-2^{b_2})$, or $b_1=b_2$. Plugging in, we see that $2^{a_1}=2^{a_2}$, or $a_1=a_2$, contradiction.\n\nNote by Ross Gao\n"

Since $\\sigma(a^n)-1$ is divisible by $2021$ for all positive integers $a$, we can first consider the special case where $a$ is prime and $a \\neq 0,1 \\pmod{43}$. By Dirichlet's Theorem (Refer to the <b>Remark</b> section.), such $a$ always exists.\n\nThen $\\sigma(a^n)-1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n a^i = a\\left(\\frac{a^n - 1}{a-1}\\right)$. In order for this expression to be divisible by $2021=43\\cdot 47$, a necessary condition is $a^n - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$. By [[Fermat's Little Theorem]], $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$. Moreover, if $a$ is a primitive root modulo $43$, then $\\text{ord}_{43}(a) = 42$, so $n$ must be divisible by $42$.\n\nBy similar reasoning, $n$ must be divisible by $46$, by considering $a \\not\\equiv 0,1 \\pmod{47}$.\n\nWe next claim that $n$ must be divisible by $43$. By Dirichlet, let $a$ be a prime that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{43}$.

The claim is trivially true for $a=1$ so suppose $a>1$. Let $a = p_1^{e_1}\\ldots p_k^{e_k}$ be the prime factorization of $a$.

It is easy to verify that if $p_i = 43$ or $p_i = 47$ then $\\sigma(p_i^{e_in}) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2021}$ for this choice of $n$, so suppose $p_i \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ and $p_i \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{47}$. Each expression in parentheses equals $\\frac{p_i^n - 1}{p_i - 1}$ multiplied by some power of $p_i$. If $p_i \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$, then FLT implies $p_i^n - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$, and if $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43}$, then $p_i + p_i^2 + \\ldots + p_i^n \\equiv 1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{43}$ (since $n$ is also a multiple of $43$, by definition).

As we increase the value of $k$, two more intersections appear on the \"left branch\":\n\n$k=4$ does not work because the \"leftmost\" point of $x=2(y-20)^2-4$ is $(-4,20)$ which lies to the right of $\\left(-\\sqrt{24}, 20\\right)$, which is on the graph $y=x^2-4$.

We can also combine these two equations to form a parabola, or a hyperbola, or an ellipse. When $(a,b),(c,d)$ are not L.I., the intersection points instead lie on a line, which is a circle of radius infinity. When the two conics only have $3,2$ or $1$ intersection point(s), the statement that all these points lie on a circle is trivially true. \n\n~Ross Gao\n"

        "solution": "\nRecall that $1000$ divides this expression iff $8$ and $125$ both divide it. It should be fairly obvious that $n \\geq 3$; so we may break up the initial condition into two sub-conditions.\n\n(1) $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$. Notice that the square of any odd integer is $1$ modulo $8$ (proof by plugging in $1^2,3^2,5^2,7^2$ into modulo $8$), so the LHS of this expression goes $5,1,5,1,\\ldots$, while the RHS goes $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,\\ldots$. The cycle length of the LHS is $2$, RHS is $8$, so the cycle length of the solution is $\\operatorname{lcm}(2,8)=8$. Indeed, the $n$ that solve this congruence are exactly those such that $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$.\n\n(2) $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$. This is extremely computationally intensive if we try to calculate all $2^1,2^2,\\ldots,2^{100} \\pmod{125}$, so we take a divide-and-conquer approach instead. In order for this expression to be true, $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{5}$ is necessary; it shouldn't take too long for us to go through the $20$ possible LHS-RHS combinations, considering that $n$ must be odd. We only need to test $10$ values of $n$ and obtain $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ or $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$.\n\nWith this in mind we consider $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{25}$. By the Generalized Fermat's Little Theorem, $2^{20} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$, but we already have $n$ modulo $20$. Our calculation is greatly simplified. The LHS's cycle length is $20$ and the RHS's cycle length is $25$, from which their least common multiple is $100$. In this step we need to test all the numbers between $1$ to $100$ that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$ or $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$. In the case that $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{20}$, the RHS goes $3,23,43,63,83$, and we need $2^n \\equiv n \\equiv 2^3 \\pmod{25}$; clearly $n \\equiv 83 \\pmod{100}$. In the case that $n \\equiv 17 \\pmod{20}$, by a similar argument, $n \\equiv 97 \\pmod{100}$. \n\nIn the final step, we need to calculate $2^{97}$ and $2^{83}$ modulo $125$:\n\nNote that $2^{97}\\equiv2^{-3}$; because $8\\cdot47=376\\equiv1\\pmod{125},$ we get $2^{97} \\equiv 47\\pmod{125}$. \n\nNote that $2^{83}$ is $2^{-17}=2^{-16}\\cdot2^{-1}$. We have\n$$\\begin{align*}\n2^{-1}&\\equiv63, \\\\\n2^{-2}&\\equiv63^2=3969\\equiv-31, \\\\\n2^{-4}&\\equiv(-31)^2=961\\equiv-39, \\\\\n2^{-8}&\\equiv1521\\equiv21, \\\\\n2^{-16}&\\equiv441, \\\\\n2^{-17}&\\equiv63\\cdot441\\equiv7\\cdot(-31)=-217\\equiv33.\n\\end{align*}$$ \nThis time, LHS cycle is $100$, RHS cycle is $125$, so we need to figure out $n$ modulo $500$. It should be $n \\equiv 283,297 \\pmod{500}$.\n\nPut everything together. By the second subcondition, the only candidates less than $1000$ are $283,297,783,797$. Apply the first subcondition, $n=\\boxed{797}$ is the desired answer.\n\n~Ross Gao (Solution)\n\n~MRENTHUSIASM (Minor Reformatting)\n"

It is easy to check $n < 3$ don't work, so we have that $n \\geq 3$. Then, $2^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}$ and $5^n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{125}$, so we just have $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$ and $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$. Let us consider both of these congruences separately.\n\nFirst, we look at $5^n \\equiv n \\pmod{8}$. By Euler's Totient Theorem (ETT), we have $5^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, so $5^5 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}$. On the RHS of the congruence, the possible values of $n$ are all nonnegative integers less than $8$ and on the RHS the only possible values are $5$ and $1$. However, for $5^n$ to be $1 \\pmod{8}$ we must have $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$, a contradiction. So, the only possible values of $n$ are when $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\implies n = 8k+5$.\n\nNow we look at $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{125}$. Plugging in $n = 8k+5$, we get $2^{8k+5} \\equiv 8k+5 \\pmod{125} \\implies 2^{8k} \\cdot 32 \\equiv 8k+5 \\pmod{125}$. Note, for $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{125}$ to be satisfied, we must have $2^n \\equiv n \\pmod{5}$ and $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{25}$. Since $2^{8k} \\equiv 1\\pmod{5}$ as $8k \\equiv 0\\pmod{4}$, we have $2 \\equiv -2k \\pmod{5} \\implies k = 5m-1$. Then, $n = 8(5m-1) + 5 = 40m-3$. Now, we get $2^{40m-3} \\equiv 40m-3 \\pmod{125}$. Using the fact that $2^n \\equiv n\\pmod{25}$, we get $2^{-3} \\equiv 15m-3 \\pmod{25}$. The inverse of $2$ modulo $25$ is obviously $13$, so $2^{-3} \\equiv 13^3 \\equiv 22 \\pmod{25}$, so $15m \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\implies m = 5s$. Plugging in $m = 5s$, we get $n = 200s - 3$.\n\nNow, we are finally ready to plug $n$ into the congruence modulo $125$. Plugging in, we get $2^{200s-3} \\equiv 200s - 3 \\pmod{125}$. By ETT, we get $2^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}$, so $2^{200s- 3} \\equiv 2^{-3} \\equiv 47 \\pmod{125}$. Then, $200s \\equiv 50 \\pmod{125} \\implies s \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\implies s = 5y+4$. Plugging this in, we get $n = 200(5y+4) - 3 = 1000y+797$, implying the smallest value of $n$ is simply $\\boxed{797}$. \n\n~rocketsri\n"

If $k^2<n<(k+1)^2$ for (positive) integer k, recursively calculating the value of the function gives us $f(n)=(k+1)^2-n+f((k+1)^2)=k^2+3k+2-n$. Note that this formula also returns the correct value when $n=(k+1)^2$, but not when $n=k^2$. Thus $f(n)=k^2+3k+2-n$ for $k^2<n \\leq (k+1)^2$.\n\nIf $2 \\mid (k+1)^2-n$, $g(n)$ returns the same value as $f(n)$. This is because the recursion once again stops at $(k+1)^2$. We seek a case in which $f(n)<g(n)$, so obviously this is not what we want. We want $(k+1)^2,n$ to have a different parity, or $n, k$ have the same parity.

        "solution": "To begin, note that if $n$ is a perfect square, $f(n)=g(n)$, so $f(n)/g(n)=1$, so we must look at values of $n$ that are not perfect squares (what a surprise). First, let the distance between $n$ and the first perfect square greater than or equal to it be $k$, making the values of $f(n+k)$ and $g(n+k)$ integers. Using this notation, we see that $f(n)=k+f(n+k)$, giving us a formula for the numerator of our ratio. However, since the function of $g(n)$ does not add one to the previous inputs in the function until a perfect square is achieved, but adds values of two, we can not achieve the value of $\\sqrt{n+k}$ in $g(n)$ unless $k$ is an even number. However, this is impossible, since if $k$ was an even number, $f(n)=g(n)$, giving a ratio of one. Thus, $k$ must be an odd number.\n\nThus, since $k$ must be an odd number, regardless of whether $n$ is even or odd, to get an integral value in $g(n)$, we must get to the next perfect square after $n+k$. To make matters easier, let $z^2=n+k$. Thus, in $g(n)$, we want to achieve $(z+1)^2$. \n\nExpanding $(z+1)^2$ and substituting in the fact that $z=\\sqrt{n+k}$ yields:\n\n$$(z+1)^2=z^2+2z+1=n+k+2\\sqrt{n+k}+1$$\n\nThus, we must add the quantity $k+2z+1$ to $n$ to achieve a integral value in the function $g(n)$. Thus.\n\n$$g(n)=(k+2z+1)+\\sqrt{n+k+2\\sqrt{n+k}+1}$$\n\nHowever, note that the quantity within the square root is just $(z+1)^2$, and so:\n\n$$g(n)=k+3z+2$$\n\nThus,\n$$\\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}=\\frac{k+z}{k+3z+2}$$\n\nSince we want this quantity to equal $\\frac{4}{7}$, we can set the above equation equal to this number and collect all the variables to one side to achieve\n\n$$3k-5z=8$$\n\nSubstituting back in that $z=\\sqrt{n+k}$, and then separating variables and squaring yields that\n\n$$9k^2-73k+64=25n$$\n\nNow, if we treat $n$ as a constant, we can use the quadratic formula in respect to $k$ to get an equation for $k$ in terms of $n$ (without all the squares). Doing so yields\n\n$$\\frac{73\\pm\\sqrt{3025+900n}}{18}=k$$\n\nNow, since $n$ and $k$ are integers, we want the quantity within the square root to be a perfect square. Note that $55^2=3025$. Thus, assume that the quantity within the root is equal to the perfect square, $m^2$. Thus, after using a difference of squares, we have\n$$(m-55)(m+55)=900n$$\nSince we want $n$ to be an integer, we know that the $LHS$ should be divisible by five, so, let's assume that we should have $m$ divisible by five. If so, the quantity $18k-73$ must be divisible by five, meaning that $k$ leaves a remainder of one when divided by 5 (if the reader knows LaTeX well enough to write this as a modulo argument, please go ahead and do so!). \n\nThus, we see that to achieve integers $n$ and $k$ that could potentially satisfy the problem statement, we must try the values of $k$ congruent to one modulo five. However, if we recall a statement made earlier in the solution, we see that we can skip all even values of $k$ produced by this modulo argument.\n\nAlso, note that $k=1,6$ won't work, as they are too small, and will give an erroneous value for $n$. After trying $k=11,21,31$, we see that $k=31$ will give a value of $m=485$, which yields $n=\\boxed{258}$, which, if plugged in to for our equations of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, will yield the desired ratio, and we're done.\n\nSide Note: If any part of this solution is not rigorous, or too vague, please label it in the margin with \"needs proof\".

        "solution": "As usual, denote $v_p(n)$ the highest power of prime $p$ that divides $n$. For divisibility by $3^3$, notice that $v_3(149^3 - 2^3) = 2$ as $149^3 - 2^3 =$ $(147)(149^2 + 2\\cdot149 + 2^2)$, and upon checking mods, $149^2 + 2\\cdot149 + 2^2$ is divisible by $3$ but not $9$. In addition, $149^9 - 2^9$ is divisible by $3^3$ because $149^9 - 2^9 = (149^3 - 2^3)(149^6 + 149^3\\cdot2^3 + 2^6)$, and the rightmost factor equates to $1 + 1 + 1 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. In fact, $n = 9 = 3^2$ is the least possible choice to ensure divisibility by $3^3$ because if $n = a \\cdot 3^b$, with $3 \\nmid a$ and $b < 2$, we write $$149^{a \\cdot 3^b} - 2^{a \\cdot 3^b} =  (149^{3^b} - 2^{3^b})(149^{3^b(a - 1)} + 149^{3^b(a - 2)}\\cdot2^{3^b}+\\cdots2^{3^b(a - 1)}).$$ Then, the rightmost factor is equivalent to $\\pm a \\pmod{3} \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, and $v_3(149^{3^b} - 2^{3^b}) = b + 1 < 3$.\n \nFor divisibility by $7^7$, we'll induct, claiming that $v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) = k + 2$ for whole numbers $k$. The base case is clear. Then, $$v_7(149^{7^{k+1}} - 2^{7^{k+1}}) = v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) + v_7(149^{6\\cdot7^k} + 2^{7^k}\\cdot149^{5\\cdot7^k} + \\cdots + 2^{5\\cdot7^k}\\cdot149^{7^k} + 2^{6\\cdot7^k}).$$ By the induction hypothesis, $v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) = k + 2$. Then, notice that $$S(k) = 149^{6\\cdot7^k} + 2^{7^k}\\cdot149^{5\\cdot7^k} + \\cdots + 2^{5\\cdot7^k}\\cdot149^{7^k} + 2^{6\\cdot7^k} \\equiv 7 \\cdot 2^{6\\cdot7^k}\\pmod{7} \\equiv 7 \\cdot 2^{6\\cdot7^k}\\pmod{49}.$$ This tells us that $S(k)$ is divisible by $7$, but not $49$ so that $v_7\\left(S(k)\\right) = 1$, completing our induction. We can verify that $7^5$ is the least choice of $n$ to ensure divisibility by $7^7$ by arguing similarly to the $3^3$ case. \n\nFinally, for $5^5$, we take the powers of $149$ and $2$ in mod $5$ and mod $25$. Writing out these mods, we have that $149^n \\equiv 2^n \\pmod{5}$ if and only if $4 | n$, in which $149^n \\equiv 2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. So here we claim that $v_5(149^{4\\cdot5^k} - 2^{4\\cdot5^k}) = k + 1$ and perform yet another induction. The base case is true: $5 | 149^4 - 2^4$, but $149^4 - 2^4 \\equiv 1 - 16 \\pmod{25}$. Now then, assuming the induction statement to hold for some $k$, $$v_5(149^{4\\cdot5^{k+1}} - 2^{4\\cdot5^{k+1}}) = (k+1) + v_5(149^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+\\cdots+2^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}).$$ Note that $S'(k) =  149^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}+\\cdots+2^{3\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}\\cdot149^{4\\cdot5^k}+2^{4\\cdot4\\cdot5^k}$ equates to $S''(k) = 1 + 2^{4\\cdot5^k} + \\cdots + 2^{16\\cdot5^k}$ in both mod $5$ and mod $25$. We notice that $S''(k) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. Writing out the powers of $2$ mod $25$, we have $S''(0) \\equiv 5 \\pmod{25}$. Also $2^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$ when $n$ is a multiple of $20$. Hence for $k > 0$, $S''(k) \\equiv 5 \\mod{25}$. Thus, $v_5\\left(S'(k)\\right) = 1$, completing our induction. Applying the same argument from the previous two cases, $4\\cdot5^4$ is the least choice to ensure divisibility by $5^5$.\n\nOur answer is the number of divisors of $\\text{lcm}(3^2, 7^5, 2^2\\cdot5^4) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^5$. It is $(2 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1)(5 + 1) = \\boxed{270}$.\n\n~hnkevin42\n"

Two of these values are $3$ and $4$, and the other two are $a$ and $b$.\n\nWe can split these four values into two \"groups\" based on the radicand in the expression - for example, the first group consists of the first two values listed above, and the second group consists of the other two values.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1}$: Both the 3 and 4 values are from the same group.\n\nIn this case, the $a$ and $b$ values are both from the other group. The sum of this is just $2c$ because the radical cancels out. Because of this, we can see that $c$ is just the average of $3$ and $4$, so we have $2c = 3 + 4 = 7$, so $(a+b)^2 = 7^2 = 49$.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2}$: The 3 and 4 values come from different groups.\n\nIt is easy to see that all possibilities in this case are basically symmetric and yield the same value for $(a+b)^2$. Without loss of generality, assume that $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 4$ and $\\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 3$. Note that we can't switch the values of these two expressions since the first one is guaranteed to be larger.\n\nWe can write $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 1 + \\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$.\n\nMoving most terms to the left side and simplifying gives $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} - \\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} = 1$.\n\nWe can square both sides and simplify:\n\n$\\sqrt{d} + d + c - \\sqrt{d} + d + c - 2\\sqrt{(d + c + \\sqrt{d})(d + c - \\sqrt{d})} = 1$\n\n$2d + 2c - 2\\sqrt{(d + c + \\sqrt{d})(d + c - \\sqrt{d})} = 1$\n\n$\\sqrt{(d + c + \\sqrt{d})(d + c - \\sqrt{d})} = (d+c) - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$\\sqrt{(d+c)^2 - (\\sqrt{d})^2} = (d+c) - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$\\sqrt{d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d} = (d+c) - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSquaring both sides again gives the following:\n\n$d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d = d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d - c + \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nNearly all terms cancel out, yielding $c = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nBy substituting this back in, we obtain $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} = \\frac{15}{4}$ and $\\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} = \\frac{11}{4}$.\n\nThe sum of $a$ and $b$ is equal to $-\\sqrt{\\sqrt{d} + d + c} - \\sqrt{-\\sqrt{d} + d + c} + 2c = -\\frac{15}{4} - \\frac{11}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = -6$, so $(a+b)^2 = 36$.\n\nAdding up both values gives $49 + 36 = \\boxed{085}$ as our final answer.\n\n"

        "solution": "We first note that since the remainder is $17$ and we are dividing by $n+5$, $n+5$ must be greater than $17$, meaning that $n$ has to be at least $13$.\n\nWe then notice that we can pair the $5^3$ term with the $n^3$ term to factor it into $(n+5)(n^2-5n+25)$ using the sum of two cubes factorization ($a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$), which is divisible by $n+5$. We can do the same for the $6^3$ term with the $(n-1)^3$ term, the $7^3$ term with the $(n-2)^3$, and so on, which are all divisible by $n+5$. However, when $n$ is odd, we will have a middle term that is not paired with any other terms, which is not necessarily divisible by $n+5$. Thus, we have two cases:\n<br><br>\n$\\textbf{CASE 1: } n$ is even <br>\nIf $n$ is even, all terms that are greater than $4^3$ pair, as there are an even number of terms that are greater than $4^3$. Therefore, all we need in order for the entire sequence to have a remainder of $17$ when divided by $n+5$ is $1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3$ to have a remainder of $17$ when divided by $n+5$.\n\nEvaluating $1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3$ as $100$, all we need to be true is \n$$100\\equiv 17\\pmod {n+5},$$\nor that\n$$83\\equiv 0\\pmod {n+5}.$$\nThus, $83$ will be divisible by $n+5$ where $n\\geq 13$. As $83$ is prime, $n+5$ must be equal to either $1$ or $83$. If $n+5=1$, we have that $n=-4$, which is not greater than or equal to $13$, so that solution is extraneous.\n\nIf $n+5=83$, we have that $n=78$, which is $\\geq 13$, so one of our solutions is $n=78$, and we are done with our first case.\n<br><br>\n$\\textbf{CASE 2: } n$ is odd <br>\nIf $n$ is odd, the only term that does not pair is the arithmetic mean of the numbers under the cube of the largest and smallest terms that would pair, or $\\left(\\frac{n+5}{2}\\right)^3$. Therefore, as all other terms that are $\\geq 5^3$ pair, the requirement that we have is\n$$1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+\\left(\\frac{n+5}{2}\\right)^3\\equiv 17\\pmod {n+5}.$$\nCalculating and simplifying, we have that\n$$83+\\left(\\frac{n+5}{2}\\right)^3\\equiv 0\\pmod {n+5}.$$\nNow, we multiply both sides by $8$. However, since multiplication is not reversible in modular arithmetic, we need to check whether any solutions are extraneous after solving. The congruence that we now have is\n$$8\\cdot 83+(n+5)^3\\equiv 0\\pmod {n+5}.$$\nAs we know that $(n+5)^3$ is divisible by $n+5$, what we need now is\n$$8\\cdot 83\\equiv 0\\pmod {n+5}.$$\nWe now check each solution to see whether it works.\n\nIf $n+5=1, 2, 4, 8$, $n$ would be less than $13$, so none of these solutions work. If $n+5=83$, $n$ would be even, so that solution does not work for this case. Therefore, the only three solutions we need to check for this case are when $n+5=166$, $n+5=332$, or $n+5=664$. We plug these values into the congruence before we multiplied both sides by $8$ to check.\n\nIf $n+5=166$, we would need\n$$83+\\left(\\frac{166}{2}\\right)^3\\equiv 0\\pmod {166}.$$\nCalculating and factoring out $83$, we have that\n$$83(1+83\\cdot 83)\\equiv 0\\pmod {166}.$$\nAs the right parenthesis is odd and $166=83\\cdot 2$, we know that this solution works, so we have another solution: $n=166-5=161$.\n\nIf $n+5=332$, we would need\n$$83+\\left(\\frac{332}{2}\\right)^3=83+166^3\\equiv 0\\pmod {322}.$$\nAs the left hand side is odd, but all multiples of $322$ is even, this solution is therefore extraneous.\n\nIf $n+5=664$, we would need\n$$83+\\left(\\frac{664}{2}\\right)^3=83+332^3\\equiv 0\\pmod {664}.$$\nAgain, the left hand side is odd, and all multiples of $664$ are even, so this solution is extraneous.\n<br><br>\nTherefore, our final answer is $78+161=\\boxed{239}$.\n<br><br>\n~ CoolCarsOnTheRun\n"

To understand this, imagine the graph of $f(z)$ on the interval $[a, a+1)$ The graph starts at $0$, is continuous and increasing, and approaches $a+1$. So as long as $a+1 > 17$, there will be a solution for $z$ in the interval.\n\nUsing this logic, we can find the number of solutions to $f(x) = y$. For every interval $[a, a+1)$ where $a \\geq \\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor $ there will be one solution for $x$ in that interval.

(We now have an upper bound for $a$ because we know $z < 2020$.) There are $2003$ solutions for $z$, and the floors of these solutions create the sequence $17, 18, 19, ..., 2018, 2019$\n\nLets first look at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 17$.

If we used the solution of $y$ where $\\left \\lfloor{y}\\right \\rfloor = 18$, there would be $2002$ solutions for $x$, and so on. So for the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 17$, there will be $2003 + 2002 + 2001 + ... + 2 + 1 = \\binom{2004}{2}$ solutions for $x$\n\nIf we now look at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 18$, there would be $\\binom{2003}{2}$ solutions for $x$. If we looked at the solution of $z$ where $\\left \\lfloor{z}\\right \\rfloor = 19$, there would be $\\binom{2002}{2}$ solutions for $x$, and so on.\n\nThe total number of solutions to $x$ is $\\binom{2004}{2} + \\binom{2003}{2} + \\binom{2002}{2} + ... + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{2}{2}$.

Thus, it is proven.\n\nNow, we see that the three resulting complex numbers have the same angle as $-1,0,$ and $(z-19)(z+1)$ as a factor of $z(z-20)$ can be taken out of both expressions. Note that the value of $z$ clearly is not 0, nor is it 20 as it has a value of $11i$.\n\nExpanding $z^2-18z-19$ with $z=a+11i$ yields\n\n$a^2-121+22ai-18a-198i-19=a^2-18a-140+22ai-198i$.

Neither of these make the denominator in the $cos(90^\\circ)$ expression 0, so they are valid. The requested result is the positive root, so the answer is $\\boxed{230}$.\n"

Suppose that there exists some prime $p$ that can not be expressed in the form $16k+1$ that is a divisor of $2019^8+1$. First, note that if the prime $p$ is a divisor of $2019$, then $2019^8$ is a multiple of $p$ and $2019^8+1$ is not. Thus, $p$ is not a divisor of $2019$.\n\nBecause $2019^8+1$ is a multiple of $p$, $2019^8+1\\equiv0\\pmod{p}$. This means that $2019^8\\equiv-1\\pmod{p}$, and by raising both sides to an arbitrary odd positive integer, we have that $2019^{16k+8}\\equiv-1\\pmod{p}$.\n\nThen, since the problem requires an odd prime, $p$ can be expressed as $16k+m$, where $m$ is an odd integer ranging from $3$ to $15$, inclusive.

If $n$ is not a multiple of $8$ but is a multiple of $4$, squaring both sides of $2019^{16k+n}\\equiv1\\pmod{p}$ also results in the same contradictory equivalence. For all remaining $n$, raising both sides of $2019^{16k+n}\\equiv1\\pmod{p}$ to the $4$th power creates the same contradiction. (Note that $32k$ and $64k$ can both be expressed in the form $16k$.)\n\nSince we have proved that no value of $n$ can work, this means that a prime must be of the form $16k+1$ in order to be a factor of $2019^8+1$.

This means that in order for the product to be a perfect square, all non 1/4 numbers rolled must come in pairs, with the only exception being the triplet 2,3, 6. Now we can do casework:\n\nIf there are four 1/4's, then there are $2^4=16$ combinations. \nIf there are three 1/4's, then there are 0 combinations, because the fourth number isn't a square. \nIf there are two 1/4's, there are $2^2=4$ ways to choose the two 1/4's, 4 ways to choose the remaining pair of numbers, and $\\frac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways to arrange, so there are $4\\cdot 4\\cdot 6=96$ combinations for this case. \nIf there is one 1/4, then there are 2 ways to choose whether it is a 1 or 4, and the remaining three numbers must be 2, 3, and 6, so there are $4!$ ways to order, meaning there are $2\\cdot 4!=48$ combinations for this case. \nOur final case is if there are no 1/4's, in which case we must have two pairs. If the two pairs are of different numbers, then there $\\binom{4}{2}$ to choose the numbers and $\\frac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways to arrange them, so $6\\cdot 6=36$. If all four numbers are the same there are $4$ combinations, so there are $4+36=40$ combinations for this case.\n\nHence there are $16+0+96+48+40=200$ combinations where the product of the dice is a perfect square, and there are $6^4=1296$ total combinations, so the desired probability is $\\frac{200}{1296}=\\frac{25}{162}$, yielding an answer of $25+162=\\boxed{187}$.\n\n-Stormersyle\n"

So we want the number which is 6/7 of the way through the interval (0, 90) so $\\theta = \\frac{6}{7}\\cdot 90 = \\frac{540}{7}$ and $p+q = 540 + 7 = \\boxed{547}$\n"

Luckily, finding $a$ is a relatively trivial task, as one can simply notice that $3^5 = 243 \\equiv 1 \\mod 121$. However, finding $b$ is slightly more nontrivial. The order of $3^k$ modulo $13$ (which is $3$) is trivial to find, as one can either bash out a pattern of remainders upon dividing powers of $3$ by $13$, or one can notice that $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 1 \\mod 13$ (the latter which is the definition of period/orders by FLT). We can thus rewrite $3^3$ as $(2 \\cdot 13 + 1) \\mod 13^2$.

Thus, our claim is proven.\nLet $f(n)$ be the second to last digit when $3^{3k}$ is written in base $13^2$. \nUsing our proof, it is easy to see that $f(n)$ satisfies the recurrence $f(1) = 2$ and $f(n+1) = f(n) + 2$. Since this implies $f(n) = 2n, $ we just have to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a multiple of $13$, which is trivially obtained as $13$.\nThe least integer $n$ such that $3^n - 1$ is divisible by $13^2$ is $3 \\cdot 13 = 39, $ so our final answer is $\\text{lcm } (5, 39) = \\boxed{195}.$\n\n-fidgetboss_4000\n-minor edits made by srisainandan6\n"

        "solution": "\nThe question asks us for the probability that a randomly chosen subset of the set of the first 18 positive integers has the property that the sum of its elements is divisible by 3. Note that the total number of subsets is $2^{18}$ because each element can either be in or not in the subset. To find the probability, we will find the total numbers of ways the problem can occur and divide by $2^{18}$.\n\nTo simplify the problem, let\u2019s convert the set to mod 3:\n\n$$U' = \\{1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0\\}$$\n\nNote that there are six elements congruent to 0 mod 3, 6 congruent to 1 mod 3, and 6 congruent to 2 mod 3. After conversion to mod three, the problem is the same but we\u2019re dealing with much simpler numbers. Let\u2019s apply casework on this converted set based on $S = s(T')$, the sum of the elements of a subset $T'$ of $U'$.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1: }S=0$\n\nIn this case, we can restrict the subsets to subsets that only contain 0. There are six 0\u2019s and each one can be in our out of the subset, for a total of $2^{6} = 64$ subsets. In fact, for every case we will have, we can always add a sequence of 0\u2019s and the total sum will not change, so we will have to multiply by 64 for each case. Therefore, let\u2019s just calculate the total number of ways we can have each case and remember to multiply it in after summing up the cases. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways you can choose such subsets without including the 0's. Therefore this case gives us $\\boxed{1}$ way.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 2: }S= 3$\n\nIn this case and each of the subsequent cases, we denote the number of 1\u2019s in the case and the number of two\u2019s in the case as $x, y$ respectively. Then in this case we have two subcases;\n\n$x, y = 3,0: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{3} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{0} = 20 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 1,1: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{1} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{1} = 36 $ ways.\n\nIn total, this case has $20+36=\\boxed{56}$ ways.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 3: }S=6$\n\nIn this case, there are 4 subcases;\n\n$x, y = 6,0: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{6} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{0} = 1 $ way.\n\n$x, y = 4,1: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{4} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{1} = 90 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 2,2: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{2} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{2} = 225 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 0,3: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{0} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{3} = 20 $ ways.\n\nIn total, this case has $1+90+225+20=\\boxed{336}$ ways.\n\nNote that for each case, the # of 1\u2019s goes down by 2 and the # of 2\u2019s goes up by 1. This is because the sum is fixed, so when we change one it must be balanced out by the other. This is similar to the Diophantine equation $x + 2y= S$ and the total number of solutions will be $\\tbinom{6}{x} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{y}$. From here we continue our casework, and our subcases will be coming out quickly as we have realized this relation.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 4: }S=9$\n\nIn this case we have 3 subcases:\n\n$x, y = 5,2: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{5} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{1} = 90 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 3,3: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{3} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{3} = 400 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 1,4: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{1} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{4} = 90 $ ways.\n\nIn total, this case has $90+400+90=\\boxed{580}$ ways.\n\n$\\textbf{Case 5: } S=12$\n\nIn this case we have 4 subcases:\n\n$x, y = 6,3: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{6} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{3} = 20 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 4,4: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{4} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{4} = 225 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 2,5: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{2} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{5} = 90 $ ways.\n\n$x, y = 0,6: $ This case has $\\tbinom{6}{0} \\cdot \\tbinom{6}{6} = 1 $ way.\n\nTherefore the total number of ways in this case is $20 + 225 + 90 + 1=\\boxed{336}$. \nHere we notice something interesting. Not only is the answer the same as Case 3, the subcases deliver the exact same answers, just in reverse order. Why is that?\n\nWe discover the pattern that the values of $x, y$ of each subcase of Case 5 can be obtained by subtracting the corresponding values of $x, y$ of each subcase in Case 3 from 6 ( For example, the subcase 0, 6 in Case 5 corresponds to the subcase 6, 0 in Case 3). Then by the combinatorial identity, $\\tbinom{6}{k} = \\tbinom{6}{6-k}$, which is why each subcase evaluates to the same number. But can we extend this reasoning to all subcases to save time?\n\nLet\u2019s write this proof formally. Let $W_S$ be the number of subsets of the set $\\{1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2\\}$ (where each 1 and 2 is distinguishable) such that the sum of the elements of the subset is $S$ and $S$ is divisible by 3. We define the empty set as having a sum of 0. We claim that $W_S = W_{18-S}$.\n\n$W_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \\tbinom{6}{x_i}\\tbinom{6}{y_i}$ if and only if there exists $x_i, y_i$ that satisfy $0\\leq x_i \\leq 6$, $0\\leq y_i \\leq 6$, $x_i + 2y_i = S$, and $D$  is the set of the pairs $x_i, y_i$. This is because for each pair $x_i$, $y_i$ there are six elements of the same residue mod(3) to choose $x_i$ and $y_i$ numbers from, and their value sum must be $S$.\n\nLet all $x_n$, $y_n$ satisfy $x_n = 6-x_i$ and $y_n = 6-y_i$.\nWe can rewrite the equation $ x_i+ 2y_i = S \\implies -x_i- 2y_i = -S \\implies 6-x_i+ 6-2y_i= 12 - S$\n$\\implies 6-x_i+12-2y_i = 18-S \\implies 6-x_i + 2(6-y_i) = 18-S $\n$$\\implies x_n + 2y_n = 18 - S$$\n\nTherefore, since $0\\leq x_i, y_i\\leq 6$ and $x_n = 6-x_i$ and $y_n = 6-y_i$, $0\\leq x_n, y_n\\leq 6$. As shown above, $x_n + 2y_n = 18 - S$ and since $S$ and 18 are divisible by 3, 18 -$S$ is divisible by 3. Therefore, by the fact that $W_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \\tbinom{6}{x_i}\\tbinom{6}{y_i}$, we have that;\n\n$W_{18-S} = \\sum_{n=1}^{|D|} \\tbinom{6}{x_n}\\tbinom{6}{y_n} \\implies W_{18-S} =  \\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \\tbinom{6}{6-x_i}\\tbinom{6}{6-y_i} \\implies W_{18-S} =  \\sum_{i=1}^{|D|} \\tbinom{6}{x_i}\\tbinom{6}{y_i} = W_S$, proving our claim.\n\nWe have found our shortcut, so instead of bashing out the remaining cases, we can use this symmetry. The total number of ways over all the cases is $\\sum_{k=0}^{6} W_{3k} = 2 \\cdot (1+56+336)+580 = 1366$. The final answer is $\\frac{2^{6}\\cdot 1366}{2^{18}} = \\frac{1366}{2^{12}} = \\frac{683}{2^{11}}. $\n\nThere are no more 2\u2019s left to factor out of the numerator, so we are done and the answer is $\\boxed{\\boxed{683}}$.\n\n\n~KingRavi\n"

        "solution": "\nFirst, instead of using angles to find $[AI_1I_2]$, let's try to find the area of other, simpler figures, and subtract that from $[ABC]$. However, to do this, we need to be able to figure out the length of the inradii, and so, we need to find $AX$. \n\n\nTo minimize $[AI_1I_2]$, intuitively, we should try to minimize the length of $AX$, since, after using the $rs=A$ formula for the area of a triangle, we'll be able to minimize the inradii lengths, and thus, eventually minimize the area of $[AI_1I_2]$. (Proof needed here).\n\n\n\nWe need to minimize $AX$. Let $AX=d$, $BX=s$, and $CX=32-s$. After an application of Stewart's Theorem, we will get that $$d=\\sqrt{s^2-24s+900}$$ To minimize this quadratic, $s=12$ whereby we conclude that $d=6\\sqrt{21}$. \n\n\n\nFrom here, draw perpendiculars down from $I_1$ and $I_2$ to $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, and label the foot of these perpendiculars $D$ and $E$ respectively. After, draw the inradii from $I_1$ to $BX$, and from $I_2$ to $CX$, and draw in $I_1I_2$. \n\nLabel the foot of the inradii to $BX$ and $CX$, $F$ and $G$, respectively. From here, we see that to find $[AI_1I_2]$, we need to find $[ABC]$, and subtract off the sum of $[DBCEI_2I_1], [ADI_1],$ and $[AEI_2]$. \n\n\n$[DBCEI_2I_1]$ can be found by finding the area of two quadrilaterals $[DBFI_1]+[ECGI_2]$ as well as the area of a trapezoid $[FGI_2I_1]$. If we let the inradius of $ABX$ be $r_1$ and if we let the inradius of $ACX$ be $r_2$, we'll find, after an application of basic geometry and careful calculations on paper, that $[DBCEI_2I_1]=13r_1+19r_2$. \n\n\nThe area of two triangles can be found in a similar fashion, however, we must use $XYZ$ substitution to solve for $AD$ as well as $AE$. After doing this, we'll get a similar sum in terms of $r_1$ and $r_2$ for the area of those two triangles which is equal to $$\\frac{(9+3\\sqrt{21})(r_1)}{2} + \\frac{(7+3\\sqrt{21})(r_2)}{2}.$$\n\nNow we're set. Summing up the area of the Hexagon and the two triangles and simplifying, we get that the formula for $[AI_1I_2]$ is just $$[ABC]-\\left(\\frac{(35+3\\sqrt{21})(r_1)}{2}+\\frac{(45+3r_2\\sqrt{21})(r_2)}{2}\\right).$$ \n\nUsing Heron's formula, $[ABC]=96\\sqrt{21}$. Solving for $r_1$ and $r_2$ using Heron's in $ABX$ and $ACX$, we get that $r_1=3\\sqrt{21}-9$ and $r_2=3\\sqrt{21}-7$. From here, we just have to plug into our above equation and solve.\n\nDoing so gets us that the minimum area of $AI_1I_2=\\boxed{126}.$\n\n-Azeem H.(Mathislife52) ~edited by phoenixfire\n"

To simplify the problem somewhat, let us imagine the seven vertices on a line $E \\leftrightarrow P_4 \\leftrightarrow P_5 \\leftrightarrow S \\leftrightarrow P_1 \\leftrightarrow P_2 \\leftrightarrow P_3 \\leftrightarrow E$. We can count the number of left/right (L/R) paths of length $\\le 11$ that start at $S$ and end at either $P_4$ or $P_3$.\n\nWe can visualize the paths using the common grid counting method by starting at the origin $(0,0)$, so that a right (R) move corresponds to moving 1 in the positive $x$ direction, and a left (L) move corresponds to moving 1 in the positive $y$ direction. Because we don't want to move more than 2 units left or more than 3 units right, our path must not cross the lines $y = x+2$ or $y = x-3$. Letting $p(x,y)$ be the number of such paths from $(0,0)$ to $(x,y)$ under these constraints, we have the following base cases:\n\n$p(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & x \\le 3 \\\\\n0 & x > 3\n\\end{cases}\n\\qquad p(0,y) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & y \\le 2 \\\\\n0 & y > 2\n\\end{cases}\n$\n\nand recursive step\n$p(x,y) = p(x-1,y) + p(x,y-1)$ for $x,y \\ge 1$.\n\nThe filled in grid will look something like this, where the lower-left $1$ corresponds to the origin:\n\n$\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\textbf{89} & & & \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\textbf{28} & 89 & & & \\\\ \\hline\n0 & 0 & \\textbf{9} & 28 & 61 & 108 & 155 & \\textbf{155} \\\\ \\hline\n0 & \\textbf{3} & 9 & 19 & 33 & 47 & \\textbf{47} & 0 \\\\ \\hline\n\\textbf{1} & 3 & 6 & 10 & 14 & \\textbf{14} & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & \\textbf{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 1 & 1 & \\textbf{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n$\n\nThe bolded numbers on the top diagonal represent the number of paths from $S$ to $P_4$ in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 moves, and the numbers on the bottom diagonal represent the number of paths from $S$ to $P_3$ in 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 moves.

By Ptolemy's theorem $d_1 d_2 = ad+bc$ for quadrilateral $A$, so, defining $K_A$ as the area of $A$,\n$$K_A = \\frac{1}{2} (ad+bc)\\sin{\\varphi_A}$$\nSimilarly, for quadrilaterals $B$ and $C$,\n$$K_B = \\frac{1}{2} (bd+ac)\\sin{\\varphi_B}$$\nand\n$$K_C = \\frac{1}{2} (cd+ab)\\sin{\\varphi_C}$$\nMultiplying the three equations and rearranging, we see that\n$$K_A K_B K_C = \\frac{1}{8} (ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)\\sin{\\varphi_A}\\sin{\\varphi_B}\\sin{\\varphi_B}$$\n$$K^3 = \\frac{1}{8} (ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{6}{7}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{70}{3}K^3 = (ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)$$\nThe circumradius $R$ of a cyclic quadrilateral with side lengths $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ and area $K$ can be computed as $R = \\frac{\\sqrt{(ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)}}{4K}$.\nInserting what we know,\n$$1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{70}{3}K^3}}{4K}\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 16K^2 = \\frac{70}{3}K^3\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{24}{35} = K$$\nSo our answer is $24 + 35 = \\boxed{059}$.\n\n~Solution by divij04\n"

In order for $\\sqrt{k} P_1 Q_1$ to be rational, $\\sqrt{k}$ must be some rational multiple of $\\sqrt{6}$. This is achieved at $\\sqrt{k}=\\sqrt{6}, 2\\sqrt{6}, \\ldots, 20\\sqrt{6}$. We end there as $21\\sqrt{6}=\\sqrt{2646}$. There are 20 numbers from 1 to 20, so there are $\\boxed{020}$ solutions.\n\nSolution by a1b2\n"

Note that the opposite sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ have equal length, and note that diagonal $\\overline{DB}$ bisects diagonal $\\overline{AC}$. This is very similar to what happens if $ABCD$ were a parallelogram with $AB = CD = 10$, so let's extend $\\overline{DB}$ to point $E$, such that $AECD$ is a parallelogram. In other words, $$AE = CD = 10$$ and $$EC = DA = 2\\sqrt{65}$$ Now, let's examine $\\triangle ABE$. Since $AB = AE = 10$, the triangle is isosceles, and $\\angle ABE \\cong \\angle AEB$. Note that in parallelogram $AECD$, $\\angle AED$ and $\\angle CDE$ are congruent, so $\\angle ABE \\cong \\angle CDE$ and thus $$\\text{m}\\angle ABD = 180^\\circ - \\text{m}\\angle CDB$$ Define $\\alpha := \\text{m}\\angle CDB$, so $180^\\circ - \\alpha = \\text{m}\\angle ABD$. \n\nWe use the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle DAB$ and $\\triangle CDB$:\n\n$$\\left(2\\sqrt{65}\\right)^2 = 10^2 + BD^2 - 20BD\\cos\\left(180^\\circ - \\alpha\\right) = 100 + BD^2 + 20BD\\cos\\alpha$$\n\n$$14^2 = 10^2 + BD^2 - 20BD\\cos\\alpha$$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first yields\n\n$$260 - 196 = 40BD\\cos\\alpha \\rightarrow BD\\cos\\alpha = \\frac{8}{5}$$\n\nThis means that dropping an altitude from $B$ to some foot $Q$ on $\\overline{CD}$ gives $DQ = \\frac{8}{5}$ and therefore $CQ = \\frac{42}{5}$. Seeing that $CQ = \\frac{3}{5}\\cdot BC$, we conclude that $\\triangle QCB$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle, so $BQ = \\frac{56}{5}$. Then, the area of $\\triangle BCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 10 \\cdot \\frac{56}{5} = 56$. Since $AP = CP$, points $A$ and $C$ are equidistant from $\\overline{BD}$, so $$\\left[\\triangle ABD\\right] = \\left[\\triangle CBD\\right] = 56$$ and hence $$\\left[ABCD\\right] = 56 + 56 = \\boxed{112}$$ -kgator\n\n\nJust to be complete -- $h_1$ and $h_2$ can actually be equal.

Similarly, after 1-2 is rolled, we denote by $P_o(2), P_e(2)$ the conditional probabilities of Odd and Even winning out, when Odd is in position.\n\nConsider the first roll. If it's not a 1, the sequence restart, but Even is now in position; if it's a 1, then Odd's winning probability becomes $P_o(1)$. So,\n$$P_o = \\frac{1}{6}P_o(1) + \\frac{5}{6}P_e$$\nIn the next roll, there are 3 outcomes. If the roll is 2, then Odd's winning probability becomes $P_o(2)$; if the roll is 1, then we stay in the sequence, but Even is now in position, so the probability of Odd winning now becomes $P_e(1)$; if the rolls is any other number, then the sequence restarts, and Odd is still in position. So,\n$$ P_o(1) = \\frac{1}{6}P_o(2) + \\frac{1}{6}P_e(1) + \\frac{4}{6}P_o$$\nIn the next roll after a 1-2 sequence, there are 3 outcomes. If the roll is a 3, Odd wins; if it's a 1, we go back to the state when 1 is just rolled, and Odd is in position; if it's any other number, then the sequence restarts, and Even is in position. So,\n$$ P_o(2) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6}P_o(1) + \\frac{4}{6}P_e$$\n\nPlug in $P_e = 1-P_o$ and $P_e(1) = 1 - P_o(1)$, we have a 3-equation linear system which is not hard to solve. The final answer is $Po=\\frac{216}{431}$. $\\boxed{647}$.\n\n-Mathdummy"

        "solution": "\nFirst, suppose $x = y + 1$. Then, the inequality becomes $1 \\leq |f(y + 1) - f(y)| \\leq 3$. In other words, the (positive) difference between consecutive function values is $1$, $2$, or $3$. Let $d_k := f(k) - f(k - 1)$. Note that\n\n$f(x) - f(y) = \\sum_{k=y+1}^{x} d_k.$\n\nThus, $\\sum_{k=1}^{6} d_k = f(6) - f(0) = 12$. Note that at most one value of $d_k$ in $\\left\\{d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6\\right\\}$ can be negative. This is because the maximum value of $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6$ would be $3 + 3 + 3 + 3 - 1 - 1 = 10$ if more than one value of $d_k$ is negative. Plugging $x = y + 2$ into the original inequality yields $2 \\leq |f(y + 2) - f(y)| \\leq 6$, which becomes $2 \\leq \\left|d_{y+2} + d_{y+1}\\right| \\leq 6$. The only way for $d_{y+2} + d_{y+1}$ to be negative while satisfying this inequality is for $\\left(d_{y+2}, d_{y+1}\\right)$ to equal $(1, -3)$ or $(-3, 1)$. However, this forces $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 + d_6 \\leq 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 - 3 = 10 < 12$, which is disallowed. Hence, we conclude that the following stronger inequality,\n\n$2 \\leq d_{y + 2} + d_{y + 1} \\leq 6,$\n\nis always true. We now have two cases of functions to count. For future reference let $D$ be the (ordered) sequence $\\left\\{d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6\\right\\}$.\n\nCase 1: There is exactly one instance of $d_k = -1$.\n\nBy the \"stronger\" inequality above, $d_{k-1} = 3$ if $k > 1$, and $d_{k+1} = 3$ if $k < 6$. If $2 \\leq k \\leq 5$, then $D$ contains the subsequence $\\left\\{3, -1, 3\\right\\}$, and the other three $d$-values sum to $7$, so they are either $3$, $3$, and $1$ in some order, or they are $2$, $2$, and $3$ in some order. Thus, each $k \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ for which $d_k = -1$ produces $6$ sequences $D$. If $k = 1$ or $k = 6$, then $D$ begins with $\\{-1, 3\\}$ or ends with $\\{3, -1\\}$, respectively. Either way, the remaining four $d$-values sum to $10$, so they can be any permutation of $\\{3, 3, 2, 2\\}$ (six permutations) or $\\{3, 3, 3, 1\\}$ (four permutations). Each of these vaues of $k$ yields $6 + 4 = 10$ sequences, so our total count for Case 1 is $4 \\cdot 6 + 2 \\cdot 10 = 44$.\n\nCase 2: All values of $d$ are positive.\n\nThen, $D$ is a permutation of $\\{3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1\\}$, $\\{3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1\\}$, $\\{3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1\\}$, or $\\{2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2\\}$.\nThe number of ways to permute three $3$s and three $1$s is $\\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot 3!} = 20$.\nThe number of ways to permute two $3$s, two $2$s, and two $1$s is $\\frac{6!}{2! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 2!} = 90$.\nThe number of ways to permute one $3$, four $2$s, and one $1$ is $\\frac{6!}{1! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 1!} = 30$.\nFinally, there is obviously only $1$ way to permute six $2$s. Our total count for Case 2 is $20 + 90 + 30 + 1 = 141$.\n\nTo complete the justification that all of these $44 + 141 = \\boxed{185}$ cases satisfy the original inequality, we leverage the fact that $\\{f(x)\\}_{x=0}^{6}$ is either monotonically increasing (Case 2) or the union of two monotonically increasing subsequences (Case 1). Consider any monotonically increasing subsequence that starts at $x = a$ and ends at $x = b$. For $a < k \\leq b$, $d_k$ will be positive, allowing us to remove the absolute value bars from the original inequality:\n\n$x - y \\leq f(x) - f(y) \\leq 3(x - y).$\n\nNow, the inequality is transitive; supposing $a \\leq x_3 < x_2 < x_1 \\leq b$, if the inequality is satisfied at $(x, y) = \\left(x_1, x_2\\right)$ and at $(x, y) = \\left(x_2, x_3\\right)$, then it is also satisfied at $(x, y) = \\left(x_1, x_3\\right)$. If we ever have a decreasing part where $f(x + 1) < f(x)$, then we can use some variant of the inequality $2 \\leq f(x + 1) - f(x - 1) \\leq 6$, which we derived earlier. This is a specific case of $x - y \\leq f(x) - f(y) \\leq 3(x - y)$, so we can finish off the argument by invoking transitivity.    \n\n-kgator\n"

We find that the altitude to side $\\overline {AB}$ is $16$, so the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $(24*16)/2 = 192$.\n\nLet the fourth vertex of the tetrahedron be $P$, and let the midpoint of $\\overline {AB}$ be $M$. Since $P$ is equidistant from $A$, $B$, and $C$, the line through $P$ perpendicular to the plane of $\\triangle ABC$ will pass through the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$, which we will call $O$. Note that $O$ is equidistant from each of $A$, $B$, and $C$.

Now integrate it taking the limits $0$ to $H$\n\n===Shortcut===\nHere is a shortcut for finding the radius $R$ of the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nAs before, we find that the foot of the altitude from $P$ lands on the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$. Let $BC=a$, $AC=b$, and $AB=c$.\nThen we write the area of $\\triangle ABC$ in two ways:\n$$[ABC]= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24 \\cdot 16 = \\frac{abc}{4R}$$\n\nPlugging in $20$, $20$, and $24$ for $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, and solving for $R$, we obtain $R= \\frac{25}{2}=OA=OB=OC$.\n\nThen continue as before to use the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AOP$, find $h$, and find the volume of the pyramid.\n\n===Another Shortcut (Extended Law of Sines)===\nTake the base $\\triangle ABC$, where $AB = BC = 20$ and $AC = 24$. Draw an altitude from $B$ to $AC$ that bisects $AC$ at point $D$. Then the altitude has length $\\sqrt{20^2 - 12^2} = \\sqrt{16^2} = 16$. Next, let $\\angle BCA = \\theta$. Then from the right triangle $\\triangle BDC$, $\\sin \\theta = 4/5$. From the extended law of sines, the circumradius is $20 \\cdot \\dfrac{5}{4} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{25}{2}$.\n"

Why is this less than $126$? Because the first time around, leading zeroes didn't count. But this time, all coefficients $3^n$ of $n<6$ need 1 and 2.\n\nCoefficient of $3^6=2$: Look at $3^5$ coefficient. If 1, all of them work because $3^7=2187-3^5=243<<2017$. That's 32 cases. Now of this coefficient is 2, then at the coefficient of $3^4=81$ is at least 1. However, $3^6*2+3^5*2+3^4>>2017$, so our answer is $126+64+32=\\boxed{222}$.\n\n=See Also=\n{{AIME box|year=2017|n=II|num-b=3|num-a=5}}\n{{MAA Notice}}"

If a cell in row a and column b is colored, that means we drew a card with color a and number b. \n\nBy pigeonhole principle, there exists a row that has 2 colored cells, and intuitively, that row is unique. There also exists a column with 2 colored cells. Call the unique row, \"Row A\", and Call the unique column, \"Column B\".\n\nIf we are able to remove a card so that we still have a card of each color and number, that means, we can erase a cell, so each row still has at least one colored cell, and so does each column. If we erase a cell not in Row A, then the erased cell's row will be empty. If we erase a cell not in Column B, the erased cell's column will be empty. Thus the cell that we erase must be in both Row A and Column B. There is only one cell in both Row A and Column B, and thus that cell must be colored.\n\nWe first count the number of successful outcomes. We must chose which row to be \"Row A\", and which column to be \"Column B\". There are 7 ways to chose \"Row A\", and 7 ways to chose \"Column B\". Because of the logic used above, the intersection of Row A and Column B must be colored. However, Row A needs to have 2 colored cells. There are 6 other uncolored cells to chose from. Similarly, there are 6 uncolored cells in Column B. \n\nNote that we can ignore all the rows and columns that contain colored cells. This is because Row A already contains 2 colored cells, and thus we can't color any more cells in Row A, similarly for Column B. The other row that contains a colored cell is not Row A, so it can only contain 1 colored cell, which it has, thus we can't color anymore cells in it. Similarly for the other column.  \n\nWe can actually remove these rows/columns. This leaves a 5x5 grid, full of uncolored cells. Each row can have 1 cell, and so can each column. We count the # of colorings from the perspective of the rows. We look at the first row, it has 5 choices. We can look at the 2nd row, it has 4 choices, as it's selected cell can't occupy the same column. We continue down the line, and see there are $5! = 120$ ways to color.\n\nThus, the # of successful outcomes is $5! \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7$.\n\nWe can then count the # of possible outcomes. \n\nWe can count the # of unsuccessful outcomes. We select \"Row A\" and \"Column B\" as usual, with $7 \\cdot 7$ ways. We don't color the intersection, so we have to color 2 cells in each. There are 6 other cells that can be colored in each, so we have ${6 \\choose 2} = 15$ ways to color each. Then, we can get rid of rows and columns using the method above and we are left with a 4x4 grid. There are $4! = 24$ ways to color. \n\nThus, the # of unsuccessful outcomes is $4! \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 7$.\n\nAfter some calculation, we get $\\frac{successful}{possible} = \\frac{successful}{successful+unsuccessful} = \\frac{5! \\cdot 6^2 \\cdot 7^2}{7^2 \\cdot(5! \\cdot 6^2 + 4! \\cdot 15^2} = \\frac{5! \\cdot 6^2}{5! \\cdot 6^2 +4! \\cdot 15^2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 6^2}{5 \\cdot 6^2 + 15^2} = \\frac{180}{180+225} = \\frac{4}{9} => 4+9 = \\boxed{13}$\n\n-Alexlikemath\n\n=See Also=\n{{AIME box|year=2017|n=II|num-b=8|num-a=10}}\n{{MAA Notice}}"

The same logic is used to find the number of bad configurations in which a town exists such that all roads lead out of it. It might be tempting to conclude that there are $5 \\cdot 2^6+5 \\cdot 2^6$ bad configurations, but the configurations in which there exists a town such that all roads lead to it and a town such that all roads lead out of it are overcounted.

If all roads lead towards Town $A$, there is no way to reach any other town starting from Town $A$. Thus, we will count the ways this occurs. (To show this, first note that there must always be a directed path that visits every town once, say \n$A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow D.$ (Redei's Theorem). Taking cases, it can be seen that if $A$ does not have all its roads leading, then $E$ must have its roads leading into it.)\n\n\n$\\textbf{Case 1}$.

If $s$ is odd, there are $\\frac{s-1}{2}$ solutions for $(x,y)$.\nNext, we do casework on the congruence of $s\\pmod{3}$ and the parody of $s$ using the information above:\n\nCase 1:\n\n$s\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, $s+1\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\n\n$s$ is even, $s+1$ is odd\n\nThere are $\\frac{s-2}{2}$ unique types of isosceles triangles in the polygon with $s$ sides. Each isosceles triangle has a unique point which connects the two congruent sides. Therefore, for each type of isosceles triangle, there exists $s$ of those triangles since the unique point can be any of the $s$ vertices. There are $\\frac{s}{2}$ types of isosceles triangles in the polygon with $s+1$ sides and $s+1$ unique points for each type of triangle. Therefore, $\\frac{s}{2}\\cdot{(s+1)}-\\frac{s-2}{2}\\cdot{(s)}=78$. Solving, we get $s=52$.\n\nCase 2:\n\n$s\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, $s+1\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\n\n$s$ is odd, $s+1$ is even\n\nUsing similar logic, there are $\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s)}$ possible isosceles triangles in the $s$ sided polygon. There are $\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s+1)}$ possible isosceles triangles in the $s+1$ sided polygon. The difference should be $78$, so $\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s+1)}-\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s)}=78$. Solving gives $s=157$.\n\nFor both of these cases, we don't have to worry about equilateral triangles since in both cases $s,s+1\\nmid3$.\n\nCase 3:\n\n$s\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, $s+1\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\n\n$s$ is even, $s+1$ is odd\n\nThere are $\\frac{s-2}{2}\\cdot{(s)}$ possible isosceles triangles in the $s$ sided polygon. The $s+1$ case is a bit more complicated, as we have to consider equilateral triangles as well. In this case, there is one solution where $x=y$, which would produce an equilateral triangle. Therefore, we subtract that case to calculate only isosceles triangles with 2 congruent sides. Only isosceles triangles with exactly 2 congruent sides have a unique point, while there exist only $\\frac{s+1}{3}$ distinct equilateral triangles in a polygon with $s+1$ sides, the rest are equivalent and symmetrical. Therefore, there are $(\\frac{s}{2}-1)\\cdot{(s+1)}+\\frac{s+1}{3}$ isosceles triangles with at least 2 congruent sides in a polygon with $s+1$ sides. Putting it together, $\\frac{s}{2}-1\\cdot{(s+1)}+(\\frac{s+1}{3})-\\frac{s-2}{2}\\cdot{(s)}=78$. Solving yields $5s=772$ which is impossible since $s$ has to be an integer. Therefore, this case is not valid.\n\nCase 4:\n\n$s\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, $s+1\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\n\n$s$ is odd, $s+1$ is even\n\nThere are  $\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s)}$ isosceles triangles in the $s$ sided polygon. Using the idea above, there are $(\\frac{s-1}{2}-1)\\cdot{(s+1)}$ isosceles triangles with 2 congruent sides in an $s+1$ sided polygon. There are $\\frac{s+1}{3}$ equilateral triangles. Therefore,  $(\\frac{s-1}{2}-1)\\cdot{(s+1)}+(\\frac{s+1}{3})-\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s)}=78$. Looking at the left hand side, it is clear that $s$ has to be negative, which is not valid. Therefore, this case is not valid.\n\nCase 5:\n\n$s\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, $s+1\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\n\n$s$ is even, $s+1$ is odd\n\nThere are a total of $(\\frac{s-2}{2}-1)\\cdot{(s)}+(\\frac{s}{3})$ isosceles triangles in a polygon with $s$ sides. There are a total of $\\frac{s}{2}\\cdot{(s+1)}$ isosceles triangles in a polygon with $s+1$ sides. Therefore, $\\frac{s}{2}\\cdot{(s+1)}-(\\frac{s-2}{2}-1)\\cdot{(s)}-(\\frac{s}{3})=78$. Simplifying, we get $s=36$.\n\nCase 6:\n\n$s\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$, $s+1\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{3}$\n\n$s$ is odd, $s+1$ is even\n\nThere are a total of $(\\frac{s-1}{2}-1)\\cdot{(s)}+(\\frac{s}{3})$ isosceles triangles in the polygon with $s$ sides. There are $\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s+1)}$ isosceles triangles in the polygon with $s+1$ sides. Therefore,$\\frac{s-1}{2}\\cdot{(s+1)}-(\\frac{s-1}{2}-1)\\cdot{(s)}-(\\frac{s}{3})=78$. Simplifying, we get $7s=471$, which means $s$ is not an integer. Thus, this case is invalid.\n\nAdding all the valid cases, we obtain $52+157+36=\\boxed{245}$\n\n~[https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Magnetoninja Magnetoninja]\n"

This corresponds to the 4 diagonals of the cube.\n\nWe look at the one from $(1,1,1)$ to $(10,10,10)$. The lower endpoint of the desired lines must contain both a 1 and a 3, so it can be $(1,1,3), (1,2,3), (1,3,3)$. If $\\textrm{min} > 0$ then the point $(a-1,b-1,c-1)$ will also be on the line for example, 3 applies to the other end.\n\nAccounting for permutations, there are $12$ ways, so there are $12 \\cdot 4 = 48$ different lines for this case. \n\n\n\n$Case \\textrm{ } 2:$ The lines where the $x$, $y$, or $z$ is the same for all the points on the line. \n\nWLOG, let the $x$ value stay the same throughout. Let the line be parallel to the diagonal from $(1,1,1)$ to $(1,10,10)$. For the line to have 8 points, the $y$ and $z$ must be 1 and 3 in either order, and the $x$ value can be any value from 1 to 10. In addition, this line can be parallel to 6 face diagonals. So we get $2 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 6 = 120$ possible lines for this case. \n\nThe answer is, therefore, $120 + 48 = \\boxed{168}$\n\nSolution by stephcurry added to the wiki by Thedoge edited by Rapurt9 and phoenixfire\n"
